            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>Reader,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>HAving spent betwixt Thirty and Forty years in a plentiful exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of my profession, and that in different Countries and Places, where I have been eye-witness of the variety of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods in Chirurgery, I think it is no great vanity for me by this time, to pretend to something of experience in the Faculty: Which how difficultly it is attained, I not only can testifie by my own frequent misad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures in this Imployment, but also do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all others that have undertaken the Art. <hi>Vita brevis, Ars longa, Experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fallax, Judicium difficile,</hi> said the great Father both of Physick and Chirurgery, of which it is true, that the former hath more of uncertainty, because the diseases are hidden as well as their causes, and little of either lyeth open to the Eye: Yet ours also
<pb facs="tcp:41836:3"/>meets with many great difficulties, and very dubious cases, such as will sometimes puzzle an old Chirurgeon, but a young one would be quite lost in, without the assistance of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Guide. This is the Reason why I think all men, that have arrived to any thing of Knowledge or Experience, are obliged by the general debt they owe to mankind, to leave behind them such Monuments of it as may be useful to posterity. Thus our Art at first grew, when <hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple at <hi>Delphos</hi> received in Tables the Histories of particular cures consecrated by the Votaries, and when Fathers bred up their Children in their own profession, faithfully delivering to them such Rules and Maxims, as their frequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations had both suggested and confirmed: Insomuch that the Art became Hereditary, and propagated in families. And it is the opinion of some learned men, that the so much admired Volume, that goes under the name of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> was the product of such a succession of Communications, there being no less than seven of that Race that were in their several generations eminent that way: The world is since grown bigger, and the Art it self much inlarg'd, by the great accession both of Diseases and Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; insomuch that Medicine, which heretofore was the work of one man, is now
<pb facs="tcp:41836:3"/>split into three parts, the <hi>Physician, Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon,</hi> and <hi>Apothecary;</hi> each finding work enough for the whole man. Yet with all this encrease of Knowledge we do but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease sorrow, and after whole Ages spent in Chirurgical and Medical Disquisitions, we find little advance towards the certainty of Cure, or the commanding of help in the necessities of nature: A great Reason of which I take to be the excess of Imployment, or (which is worse) disingenuity in great Practitioners, who have not often been free in communicating their Observations to the world, but have rather left that task to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary men, who having Chairs in Ʋni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities, have more indulg'd themselves in the speculation of the Art, than in a diligent attendance to matter of fact; who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Art into method, have spoken ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pursuantly to their own Rules, than agreeably to our Experience: Hence it is thought, that from <hi>Galen</hi>'s days, who first drew Physick into a strict Body, we have found little Augmentation of Knowledge, till some bold adventurers in these latter Ages have made some fortunate Essays at farther discoveries.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, I shall not pretend to new Inventions, only what I have, I do here
<pb facs="tcp:41836:4"/>bring as my Mite to the Treasury of other mens Learning; affecting more the praise of fidelity and easiness of being understood, than of having enriched my Faculty with any far-fetcht or novel additions: Our Art is rich enough already in that kind, Nature having plentifully supplied us with a <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Medica</hi> in every field; nor need we any other Instructions than in the use of that Store we find ready provided for us. In this such men as have spent their whole Time and Parts in a perpetual Practice, are the best Instructors, of which, whether I deserve to be reckoned for one, the ensuing Treatise must tell you: It being an Essay to a further work, which if this succeeds, may hereafter be offered to the use of the world. Why I have begun with a Treatise of Wounds, will easily be guessed by those who know me to have spent so much of my Time in Armies and Navies, in both which it was my chief business during my abode in that Imployment. I have observed many great Errors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in dressings, very much to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and often to the destruction of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; to which notwithstanding custome and frequency of example have given countenance. This very consideration did more excite me, when I once understood his Majesties design
<pb facs="tcp:41836:4"/>of a Navy Royal, where many young Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons being employed, and my Sickness of Body and my present relation to his Majesty render'd me not so fit for attendance there, as both my Genius and my desire of serving his Majesty makes me inclinable; I thought it my duty to assist, at least with such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as my Pen will afford, faithfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering those methods of Cures, which I my self have practised with success, and by giving early notice of such Errors as have been observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, either in my own, or other mens practice, arming them as well as I could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all misfortunes in the Faculty. I have therefore chosen the method that seemed to me the most easie and facil, and most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to practice, still confirming Rules by Examples, and thereby illustrating what ever might else seem obscure. Not that I was ignorant how hard a task I have undertaken to speak of things of this nature, whilst so many both Chirurgeons and Patients who are therein concerned, are yet alive; which is the reason why in some difficult cases, I have chosen to give so few Instances, as making use only of such as I was either concerned in my self alone, or such as might give least offence to others, which I have avoided as carefully as I could: For which cause I have made choice of such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations
<pb facs="tcp:41836:5"/>as may be rather for the Readers instruction than my own credit, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well my unprosperous attempts as my succesful administrations.</p>
                  <p>The Lecture of <hi>Fractures</hi> was first written and read in the <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> and <hi>Barbers-Hall,</hi> and had been pursued by the rest, had not the Fire prevented us, and that occasion given a stop to a laudable custome. The Treatise of <hi>Gun-shot</hi> was afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, and that of <hi>Simple wounds</hi> last, one thing begetting another, but when they were done, I put them into that order which did seem most agreeable to the design I now have in publishing them. I mention this here, that if any thing happen to be preposterous in the several Treatises, your charity may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with an excuse for it.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that this discourse (the former part of that of <hi>Simple wounds</hi> excepted) were done long since for the use already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, though since pollish't and fill'd up; Several other little things, as of <hi>Tumors, Fistula</hi>'s, and <hi>Lues venerea</hi> (all which ly rough cast) and may come to light, if the success of this small Tract encourage me: I have taken pains in one part of Tumors, which my relation to his Majesties service hath engaged me, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Kings-Evil;</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:41836:5"/>which I wonder so little hath been written by the Chirurgeons of the English and French Courts, both which Kings do so publickly exercise themselves in the Cure of it: And though so many thousands of people pass through the hands of the Chirurgeons to be judg'd of, and presented to their Princes, yet excepting that of <hi>Laurentius,</hi> and an imperfect piece or two of our Countrey-men, there is nothing appeares in print concerning it. I therefore thought it worth my pains to write what I have observed in that disease, hoping withal to give so much credit to our Society in this Nation, as to let the world know, we do not all spend our time in talking in <hi>Coffee-houses,</hi> and drolling over the Accidents that befal one another in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; but that some of us at least make it our business to Improve our Faculty and to give Strangers, pretenders to great things in Chirurgery, that come over to us (and are so Wellcome to our Gentry, only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being Strangers) occasion of understanding, that they may whilst they are here, traffick for Skill as well as money, and carry that back with them, which may give the world some opinion of the Knowledge and Experience of our English Artists, as well as of the liberality of their Patients.</p>

                  <p>I do pretend to have spent my time in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Navies, and Cities, not in Ʋniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Nor to have been much conversant in Books, through my constant Employment in, and the little leisure I had from my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, till my want of health of late years enforced me to make them my diversion. Therefore thou must not expect a nice exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the disposition of the parts of this Book, which it may be from a perfect <hi>Logician</hi> thou wouldst; yet I hope I have done so much that way as will excuse me from being altogether rude, and what it wants in that kind, will possibly be made up by its accommodation to the Chirurgeons hand in dressing, to which I have wholly applied my self; as thinking it more profitable for the persons, to whose use I design it. The whole is contracted into a little bulk, and yet I hope nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is necessary to thy Instructions; It becomes by this means cheaper and more por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and if those conveniencies be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a sufficient perspicuity in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and fulness in handling what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, it is all that is desired by thy Friend to serve thee,</p>

                     <p>A <hi>Wound is a solution of continuity in any part of the Body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Wound defined.</note>
                        <hi>suddenly made by any thing that Cuts or Tears, with a divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Skin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS definition differs much from what is usually delivered by Authors, and it is fit it should, for they generally defining a Wound by a solution <hi>in parte molli,</hi> do thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Cut made into a Bone; as that into the <hi>Cranium</hi> by a Pole-Axe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which why it should not be called a Wound I know not? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I say it is made by any thing that Cuts or Tears; other Authors define it to be made by an external Instrument, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How then do they call that <hi>fracturam cum vulnere,</hi> a fracture with a Wound, where the Bone from within makes the Wound, and thrusts it self quite through the flesh? <hi>Sennertus</hi> adds to his Definition, that it be done <hi>à re secante &amp; acutâ;</hi> yet he reckons those for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41836:9"/>Wounds that are made by Bullets, although it be Canon-shot.</p>
                     <p>I do therefore think it fit to make my definition more comprehensive, and to take in whatsoever makes a sudden solution of continuity, at least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and by it self, on what part soever it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; so a Cut into a Bone is a Wound, tearing the Flesh, Nerve, Sinew, Tendon or Cartilage, by Bullet, Stone, Splinter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a Wound; only I add this restriction, that the Skin must be likewise divided: By which last words I exclude fractures that come not through the skin and contusions, if the exterior parts be continuous. But by the word Skin, I understand not only the external <hi>cutis,</hi> but also the Inward membranes of the Gullet, Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, Guts, Bladder, Urethra, Womb, all which are capable of Wounds from sharp Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether swallowed or thrust into them.</p>
                     <p>A Wound thus defined admits of many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Wounds.</note> of which I know none that can be properly called essential. Great and small, deep and shallow, wide and narrow, streight and crooked, round and Angular, are but Accidental differences. Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons taken from the Weapons whether sharp or blunt; Sword, Rapier or Bullet; Cut, prick or Tearing, the likewise Accidental: Those that look most like essential differences are they which are taken from the subject in which the Wound (which is it self but an Accident) inhereth, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Flesh, Skin, Brain, Nerve, Tendon, Artery, Vein, Gristle, Bone <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which being the several subjects of Wounds may well be allowed to specifie them, and so much the rather, because from the nature of them we raise our greatest Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41836:9"/>of altering the method of Cure. To this head may also be referred the division of them into <hi>Simple</hi> or <hi>Compound.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wounds are in themselves so visible,<note place="margin">Signs and progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> that they need no general marks to be known by. But the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar affections of the particular parts hurt, and the methods of discovering what Inward part is Wounded, by observation made of the symptomes that happen, are fully handled in the Treatise of Gun-shot-wounds, to which I refer you: And not they only, but the prognosticks also are there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, in w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> a Chirurgeon ought to be well versed, lest through ignorance of them he undertake the Cure of Wounds that are mortal. I therefore have translated them to that Treatise, because the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Knowing them in cases of Gun-shot, is much greater than in those of other Weapons. The greater symptoms likewise,<note place="margin">Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</note> as <hi>Gangrena, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralysis, Spasmus,</hi> are there distinctly treated of, as being more frequent and important in Gun-shot-wounds than elsewhere; <hi>Hemorrhagiae</hi> are spoken of in this present Treatise.</p>
                     <p>As to Intentions of Cure,<note place="margin">Intentions of Cure.</note>
                        <hi>the Wound being a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of continuity</hi> doth require to be made One again. Unity being the perfection of whatsoever hath a being. To effect this, is the work of Nature and Art: both must mutually joyn their helping hands, and unless both the vital faculties and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment of the part do assist the Art of the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, it will be lost labour, here must be a joynt meeting and agreement of all in one.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Simple</hi> Wounds the Chirurgeon is to afford his assistance Five manner of ways, the omitting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41836:10"/>of any of which will render him negligent or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in his Trade.</p>

                        <hi>The fifth is to prevent ill Accidents, and to correct such as have already seized on the part.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much is required of us if the Wound be only <hi>Simple;</hi>

                     <p>As long as there is <hi>Alienum quid,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The First Intention in taking out Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> some strange Body or different substance to keep off the Unition, you must not hope to make any Cure of a Wound; therefore if any such be to be drawn forth, before you attempt it, consider seriously; first whether it can be done or no; secondly, whether safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>For first, sometimes the Weapon sticketh so fast,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41836:10"/>that by no Art it can be extracted; then it is of necessity to be left to Nature, who this way some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worketh miracles: <hi>Mercatus in Lib.

                     <p>Secondly, You are to consider whether you may with safety pluck out the Weapon or no; some will live a day with the Weapon in their Bodies, which would expire upon the moment of extraction; but if your judgment suggest to you that the Patient is recoverable, make haste out with it before the part be inflamed, or else you must stay until digestion.</p>
                     <p>If the Weapon have not pierced deep,<note place="margin">Which way the Weapon is to be drawn out.</note> and through great Vessels and Nervous places: If the part opposite be full of Veins, Arteries and Nerves, or have a Bone in it over against the Wound; If there be no great fear of Laceration, pull it out the same way it went in; for the effecting of which, our Masters have left us variety of Instruments, the figure and usage whereof you may see in <hi>Scultetus.</hi> But if the point of the Weapon have pierced above the half way, and there be no Bones nor notable Vessels to hinder you, (here is use of your Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and exact Knowledge of the parts) either thrust the Weapon through, or make way for it by incision on the contrary side; but beware the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon be not too big, lest you do make two large Wounds for one.</p>
                     <p>If the Weapon stick in the Bone,<note place="margin">Weapon stuck in a Bone.</note> move it up and down to loosen its point, and then pluck it out; but in case it will not move, cut away the Bone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you extract it.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41836:11"/>
                     <p>If a Weapon be fastned betwixt two joynts,<note place="margin">Weapon stuck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Joynts.</note> make an extension of the parts both ways, as it is the manner in Fractures and Dislocations, that so the Tendons and Ligaments being Elonged, the Weapon may with more ease come out; but do this with moderation, lest you break some notable Vessels, and a flux of Bloud or some ill Accident befall you as you extract it. It will be necessary in this work that you consider the Position the part was in when the Wound was Inflicted. <hi>Gesner</hi> hath a story in his Observ. <hi>de Chirurgiae dignitate &amp; praestantia,</hi> of a Chirurgeon, who when he could by no means get forth an Arrow, asked the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Patient in what Figure of his Body he received the Wound, understanding it was done on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, he placed him in a riding posture, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drew out the Weapon.</p>
                     <p>The Weapon thus drawn out, cleanse it from Rags or ought else, and permit the Wound to bleed accordingly, as you in your judgment shall think fit, you having respect to the constitution and habit of Body, that what is in the small Veins cut asunder may flow out as well to hinder Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as the generation of much Matter. The Bleeding stay'd, if there be Hair growing about the Wound, shave it off, then wipe away the clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bloud with a Spunge dipt in Red-wine, Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate or Water. But if it stick in the Wound deep, be not too busie with your armed Probe, for thereby you may stir up a new bleeding; whereas this concreted, keeps the Wound warm, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it from the outward Air, and by digestion Nature will thrust it forth.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THIS Intention is delivered in a few words, but they are as a Law to be observed,<note place="margin">Unition is to be made.</note> for without that reduction of the Lips a slow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed healing follows. Nature hath nothing to do here in bringing the Lips together, that is the sole work of the Chirurgeon, who must not lay a Pledgit, or croud a Dossel of Lint or Tent into a little Wound. No, that is the way to keep the Wound open, and make it painful, whereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions are stirr'd up, the Temperament of the part weakned, and the Cure prolonged; contrary to the Intention of all who have writ of them, and to the practice of our Knowing Chirurgeons here: But amongst the pretenders to that Art, we often meet with such work; particularly in a young man Wounded near <hi>Highgate</hi> in the Back,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Dossils in Simple Wounds.</note> slanting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the right Scapula, another wound on the Back, and another through the upper part of the other Shoulder, with a long Gash over the forehead, and with other wounds, some whereof not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41836:12"/>The next day I was carried thither to Dress these Wounds, I found them all distended with Tents and Dossils of Lint, disposed to inflame and swell; the Patient exceeding full of pain: after I had taken out these Extraneous Bodies, my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was to Dress them so, as I might encline their up-heaved Lips to return to their Natural scite; to which purpose I fomented them with Milk, and drest them with Pledgits spread with my digestive of <hi>Tereblnth. cum vitel. ovi,</hi> and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocated them with <hi>Ol. Ros.</hi> and by Empl. <hi>è Bolo,</hi> and Bandage with gentle compression I drest him up, and afterwards here in Town Cured him by <hi>Sarcotics</hi> and <hi>Epulotics,</hi> as in Compound Wounds, a longer work which at first ought to have been by Agglutination: Parts separated and disjoyned are to be brought together gently and equally, that they may touch one another, and so be prepared for Unition.</p>
                     <p>This must be done first gently <hi>sensim &amp; sensim,</hi> as <hi>Fallopius</hi> hath it, by little and little, not hastily at one pluck: If the parts be equally soft bring them equally together:<note place="margin">First Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> if the one soft, the other hard, and not to be moved, but with difficulty, bring the soft part to the stubborn. If the part be grown stiff with cold, as if they had been left in the fields all night, which after a Battel hath often hapned, (and particularly to a merry fellow, a common Souldier, that used to wear an Iron Skull under a Cap, and from thence was call'd by a Nick-name; his wounds were large, and the Lips hardened with the cold, and it was well for him his bleeding being thereby stay'd) in this case you are with Milk or warm-Water, and Oyle to supple them by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation or Embrocation, till you perceive the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41836:12"/>Lips made soft enough for your purpose, before you endeavour Re-union.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Equally, that the parts cut asunder may answer one another, as well <hi>in profundo,</hi> as <hi>in superficie,</hi> the Top as the Bottom, Brim to Brim; and, if possible, underneath Vessel to Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,<note place="margin">Secondly, Equally.</note> that Nature may be in a capacity of doing its own work, and by vertue of its Balsam, Reunite, Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinate, Consolidate, and Heal the Wounds: In all which Intentions she is the Agent, and the Chirurgeon only the Assistant, which Assistence, that it may be more effectually given, we must go on to the Third.</p>
                     <div type="subpart">
                        <head>THe Third Intention is Deligation,<note place="margin">The Third Intention retaining the parts United.</note> or Retaining the parts so joyned together.</head>
                        <p>For the effecting of this, our famous Masters have left us two principal means, <hi>fascias &amp; sutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> Rowling and Stitching; to which some, nay most of them added <hi>fibulas,</hi> or Clasps: But I will not put you upon that. If the Wound be small <hi>in parte molliore,</hi> in a fleshy part in the Limbs, and according to the length of the Fibres and Member; if the Wound be Simple, and in a sound Body, you may perform the whole Cure only by <hi>Bandage,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Bandage.</note> for here Nature will truly act her part by application of Bloud and nourishment to both sides indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and finish the <hi>Coalitus</hi> without your further assistance: this is that which gives such credit to the Sympathetick Powder. In the application of this, it becomes every Chirurgeon to be much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, in respect of the unspeakable commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the whole Art receiveth by them.</p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41836:13"/>
                        <p>By them not only are parts dextrously accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated for Union,<note place="margin">Their Use.</note> but such also as would unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally grow together kept asunder, in Burnings, Scaldings, &amp;c. The Finger or Ham would many times grow together, the Chin would grow to the Breast, the Arms to the sides, were they not this way hindred. By them are fluxes averted, and the delapse of humors into the inferior parts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and being already lodged they are prest out. By these are good Juice wisely forced into parts Emaciated, as if the Right Arm pine away, Rowl up the Left from the hand to the arm-pit, that the bloud being prest out into the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> or rather hindred to flow in so fast by the Artery, may with more eagerness flow into the other side where it was wanting: By these we see great fluxes of bloud, large Hemorrhages every day stayed: By them are ill shaped Ulcers brought into better figures, made more apt to be Cured: By them are the force of your application helpt and furthered, they keeping them close to their proper places, where your care hath bestowed them: By them is the true natural form and beauty of the part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly preserved.</p>
                        <p>Three especial sorts of Fasciation or Rouling pertaining to our present work have the Worthies of our Profession commended to posterity;<note place="margin">Three sorts of Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Use.</note> the first they term <hi>Incarnatrix</hi> or <hi>Agglutinatrix,</hi> the Incarnative or Agglutinative: The second <hi>Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi> or Retentive: The third <hi>Expultrix,</hi> or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive.</p>
                        <p>The Incarnative is that which brings the Lips of the Wound together,<note place="margin">1. Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native.</note> and conserveth them in their right Figure; it must be more strict than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41836:13"/>and more loose than the Expulsive, and is the most useful in simple, fresh, and yet bleeding wounds; The manner of performing it is thus,</p>
                        <p>Have in readiness a Rouler of such matter, length and breadth as I shall anon shew you, Roule it up at both ends firmly to the middle; then lay the middle part of the Rouler on that part which is opposite, to prevent pain and Inflammation, and to cherish the heat of the part, you are, after you have made a turn upon the wound with both ends of the Roulers, to go up with the one and down with the other, and take so many turns about the part, according as may be requisite, for the restraining the flux of bloud, or according to the season of the year, to defend from Cold, and yet not keep the wound too hot, for that may weaken the part; you must also be careful that your Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage be not too hard so as to intercept the Spirits, your Bandage running downwards will press out the matter from the affected part, and by passing upward hinder the Influx of humours and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Fascia retentrix,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> is used to keep on close Applications about the wound, for cure of the Patient; and these are they that are only in use, in wounds of the Head: there must be a moderation of this Bandage.</p>

                           <hi>Fascia Expulsiva</hi> is performed by a Rouler of one head,<note place="margin">3 Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.</note> the special use of it is to expell matter out of <hi>Fistula's,</hi> or the Sinuous Ulcers, and also to keep out and stay the descent of Humours, and to expel such as have already seated themselves upon the part wounded, or otherwise; I do it in the manner following.</p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41836:14"/>
                        <p>Begin in the sound part, beneath the seat of the Humours, and then Rowl hard at first, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as you come nearer the mouth of the Wound gentler and gentler; if you will press out the Matter contained in the Cavity about the Ulcer, Rowl loosely a turn or two, then harder, and yet a little streighter, the higher you go to hinder the descent of Humours, but not too hard for fear of harm, <hi>Terminus sit bona laborantis tolerantia, Celsus:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">How hard to bind.</note> Let it be made with such moderation, as the Patient may well endure.</p>

                        <p>Fasten not your Rowler by tying a knot,<note place="margin">How to be fastned.</note> nor yet sew it upon the wound, or where you cannot easily come at it again, lest you hurt your Patient; quickness and neatness distinguisheth the Workman from the ignorant and unskilful; as the subject is the more noble you work on, so strive to perform your office more excellently, intending not only your profit but decency in the dispatch, that you may please the eye both in the time of, and when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41836:15"/>you have done your work. Thus shall you gain credit to your self, and endear your Patient to submit the more readily to your Rules, which is not the least part of the cure.</p>
                        <p>The next thing that offers it self for keeping the Lips of the wound together are Sutures,<note place="margin">Sutures 3 Sorts.</note> and they are of three Sorts; the Incarnative, the Restrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and the third Conserver,<note place="margin">Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> the first is that which is in most use amongst us, and is by making so many stitches at a distance.</p>
                        <p>The Second is the Glovers stitch,<note place="margin">Restrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or Glovers Stitch.</note> and much in use among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they stitch almost all wounds by it; in the Forehead and Face I have seen them bring the wound very close, and the third day they commonly cut the knot off, and draw the Thread out, then with dry stitches keep them so brought together, and so in two or three dayes more the wound is cured.</p>
                        <p>The Third Stitch is in great wounds to hold them forceably together;<note place="margin">Conserver.</note> it is performed as in Hair-lips.</p>
                        <p>There are Four sorts of Stitches, mentioned by the Ancients, for the wounds of the Belly, whereof I shall take notice only of one, which I have made use of my self, in the stitching of those wounds; the manner whereof is thus,</p>
                        <p>You are to take up the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> on one side, and leave it on the other, and then take it up on the other side, and leave it on this; This is thus made, that the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> which is a dry Body may be united with the Musculous flesh, otherwise only the fleshy parts would unite, and the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneum</hi> not, through which a <hi>Hernia</hi> succeeds, whereby you put the Patient to the wearing a Truss
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41836:15"/>the rest of his Life, and to other trouble. The Thread, you ought to use for this purpose, is to be a white, strong and round Thread, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Needle, and both according to the wound.</p>
                        <p>You will remember to cleanse the wound of its clotted bloud, if you can; but however go on with your work, that bloud will find its passage out.</p>
                        <p>In great fluxes of bloud the Glovers stitch is best, be sure in your stitching, you bring the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Vein to his wounded fellow, so shall you the likelyer secure your self, and make the work more shape-like.</p>
                        <p>In the Incarnative you are to consider the wound. If the wound be but the length of a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers breadth or a little more, 'tis not worth the stitching, your Medicaments and Bandage will keep the lips of the wound together, and quickly heal.</p>
                        <p>If the wound be of two fingers breadth,<note place="margin">The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Stitches.</note> make one stitch in the middle, if three fingers breadth two stitches, if four fingers breadth three stitches, and so go on making a stitch less than the wound is in number of the fingers, <hi>ut semper numerus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitorum uno superet numerum punctorum, so as the number of the fingers breadth always exceed by one the number of the Stitches;</hi> sometimes in declining parts we make our stitches at a little more distance.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41836:16"/>must use your Judgment, for sometimes the wound seems to be agglutinated, while the Lips are held together by Suture, which after the Stitches are cut out is not so exactly Cicatrized,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> but that you might have done better to have left the Stitches a day longer;<note place="margin">Dry Stitches.</note> but thereto the dry Stitches will help you, which is the next way of keeping these wounds together; they are made with little bits of strong linnen Cloath, Triangular or Quadran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, or of such figure as may serve your purpose; these are most in use in the Face to avoid Stitching, and are of use in other parts to preserve the Stitches; These are commonly spread with <hi>Sang. dracon.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41836:17"/>accustomed themselves to drinking of strong drink, that without such a proportion they cannot live, <hi>I</hi> could instance it by many stories if it were necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but one for all, and from abroad,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>E. B.</hi> cured by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wine.</note>
                           <hi>Ed.

This I have seen often in some of our <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> at Sea, who drank extraordinarily, and were full of drink in our Sea-fights, I could scarce ever cure them without allowing them Wine, and thereby their Spirits were kept up, and I had the liberty to bleed them as I thought fit.</p>
                        <p>It hath been a common saying, <hi>a hair of the same Dog,</hi> and that Brandy-wine is the common relief to such; what then must become of such a one after a hard drinking for many months together, if he chance in heat of drink to be wounded, and from that time his Chirurgion condemn him to <hi>Ptisan</hi> for a week together, nay two daies? will he not Faint and languish, his wounds become In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41836:18"/>and Inflamed? you may laugh at my pleading for them, but I hope you will consider I am a water-drinker the while.</p>
                        <p>In other things such diet is to be observed as their strength will permit, we do not use to purge in wounds with Cathartics lest by stirring matter it flow to the weak part, but allow Lenitives, as <hi>Cassia, Tamarinds, Manna, Sena, Rhubarb.</hi> with <hi>Sal. Prunel.</hi> also <hi>Electuaries</hi> as <hi>Lenitiv. diaprun. syr. Ros. sol. de cichor. cum Rhubarbaro,</hi> also Broaths wherein hath been boyled Lettuce, Succory, Endive, Sorrel, Purslane, Borage, Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loss, &amp;c. and bleed according to the strength of Body, and as Symptomes Indicate in a direct line of the same side.</p>
                        <p>Another part of the Regiment of wounded persons will consist in giving of Vulnerary drinks,<note place="margin">Of Vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary drinks powders and Electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries.</note> of which we find many mentioned by Authors, and the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> very large, witness that great tribe of Vulneraries in <hi>Perkinson</hi>'s Herbal.</p>
                        <p>The most common Simples with us in <hi>England</hi> are, Comfrey, Bugle, Ladies Mantle, Agrimony, Sanicle, Pauls betony, Fluellin, Periwinkle, Mugwort, Plantain, Horse-tail, Adders-tongue, Avens, Cinkefoil, Wild Tansie, Vervain, Ground-Ivy, Golden-rod, Herb trinity, Centaury, St. Johnswort, Snakeweed, Knot-grass, Mouseare, Yarrow, Scordium, Strawberry leaves and roots, Tormentill, Bistort, Valerian, Red roses, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Some of these are made choice of to be boiled in water with white Wine and Honey, of which sort you have a sufficient example in the <hi>decoctum Traumaticum</hi> of the Dispensatory.</p>
                        <p>Their principal use is in wounds of the <hi>Thorax</hi>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41836:18"/>and <hi>Abdomen,</hi> though they be of frequent use in all great wounds. Sometimes also if the disease run out to a length we add <hi>Guajacum, Sarsa,</hi> and Scorbutical Medicines.</p>
                        <p>There are likewise Powders made of Crabbs-eyes, Coral, Nutmegg, &amp;c. and Electuaries of the roots and hearbs beaten up with those Powders.</p>
                        <p>The particular Regiment is in preserving the natural heat and tone of parts,<note place="margin">Second Particular.</note> without which we can hope for no union. For the better understanding hereof I must put you in mind that there is not any part of our Body admits of a solution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity without pain; every scratch in the skin and little cut in the finger is painful, much more wounds in the flesh; This pain stirs up a heat which ferments in the Serous part of the Bloud, which readily makes way to the wound, and if not timely prevented distends and raises the part into a Tumor and Inflames. If this happens in a full Body, or one of an ill habit, where the bloud is Serous and more apt to ferment, the mischief is greater; and if the wound be in a declining part, as the legs, the Influx of humours are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, and the member through its weakness not able to assimilate, nor yet expell; whence cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities heap upon the lower parts and makes an oedematous Tumour there.</p>
                        <p>To make this more plain,<note place="margin">A Person prickt with a Thorn in his leg.</note> I shall give you one Instance of the many that happen daily; A young Gentleman of about 18 years of age, of a good habit of Body, one day sporting in the Country with his Gun and dogs, was prickt with a Thorn on the outside of the Calf of his leg, he takes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41836:19"/>little notice of it, returning in the evening to his home, he drest his leg with a little Balsam, the next morning it was more painful, Inflames and Terminates in a <hi>Phlegmon;</hi> I am sent for after a few days, and find the Tumour large with great Inflammation, and suppurated; In the lower part, about the foot an oedematous Tumour: I opened the Tumour, and discharged a quantity of Matter, and cured the Patient as is usual in <hi>Phlegmons.</hi> If this Person had been treated according to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Regiment by bleeding and Lenient purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, &amp;c Nay if only after this particular Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the preserving the Temperament of the part, which ought in this case to have been by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerants and astringents to have prevented the Influx of humours, and applied some maturative to the festered Scratch or prick,<note place="margin">Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the beginning of a Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> as <hi>ung.

                        <p>In all Wounds where I propose to Cure by Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutination, and would preserve my Stitches, I forbear the use of Fomentations and slabby Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: nor will you have occasion for such appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, if you proceed rationally as you ought to do; I always accounting these simple Wounds cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when the Lips are well brought together, and dressed as above-said. Indeed in large and deep Wounds, where the Muscles and Tendons are cut through, there the Wound may require to have a space left open in a declining corner for discharge of Matter, lest it be healed outwardly, and some Matter shut in, whereby it becomes an hollow Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. In this case you may use Fomentations and Embrocations. This is to be left to the judgment of the Chirurgeon, who is not to doubt but that Nature will do much towards the Agglutination of the wound; if influx of humors be kept off by his Art. But if the wound be so great and deep that you cannot bring the Lips close together, then in a declining part you may put in a Tent with a Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stive <hi>è Terebinth. &amp; vitel. ovi,</hi> Turpentine being one of the most proper Medicaments in all Wounds, especially those of the Nervous parts; for it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves Bruises from corrupting and putrifying, strengthens the part, eases pain; and this it doth by its Digestive Faculty, and is thus commonly used.

Mr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> now one of the Chirurgeons of St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Hospital, was once a fellow-labourer with me in the Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such: At <hi>Sterling</hi> Mr. <hi>Chace</hi> the Kings Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary assisted me in the Dressing many such, and one with such a Gash thwart the nape of the Neck, as it was our wonder that he lived: All these wounds inflicted behind were full of Maggots, they having been some days Undrest: These Wounds I stuped with a decoct. <hi>Absinth.

'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to pour Oyle or Balsam into these Wounds, but then it must run down, or be prest out of them again: the parts about we likewise Embrocated and applied over all <hi>Empl. de Lithargyro,</hi> with Compress and Bandage: digestion once made, we then deterg'd with <hi>Mund.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41836:23"/>open; and if it be not large enough, he ought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently by Cutting, to inlarge it, while the wound is warm, and dress with your digestive warm, and let him Embrocate the part, the whole length as it is affected, with <hi>Ol.

If after all these endeavours the wound do digest, yet will not Cure, however he ought not presently to open his wound a-thwart the Muscles, nor yet according to the Fibres of them, to such a length, not though it may be done without laming the Patient; but shall in such a wound, at the first while it is recent, make search with a Probe to the bottom of it, and with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without, feel what thickness the skin is from it, and keep this place as a mark in time of need, for to make the Apertion in; and if he do after dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion apply his Caustick there, the Matter will thereby discharge, and the Patient be happily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; whereas the cutting open such a Wound the whole length hazards his Patients life, and makes a long work for himself.</p>

The way to stop the flux of Bloud, as it is common in wounds, is by retaining the Lips of the wound together by Suture or Bandage, and by applying such Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them as have a drying and Agglutinative faculty; as <hi>Galen</hi>'s Powder, <hi>Aloes p. j.

This is our first and common way of Dressing wounds, to stop the bleeding and prevent Inflammation, and is not taken off until the third day, by which time the bleeding is stopt, and the wound near Agglutinated; but if the wound be great and deep, so as you cannot bring the Lips of the wound together, then apply those Powders of <hi>Galen</hi>'s upon Dossils upon the bleeding Vessels, and your astringent next, and a Compress wet in Oxicrate, with good Bandage over all, and by the next dressing you may hope that bleeding is stopt by incarnation, if by your Probing you cause not a new flux of Bloud.</p>

                     <p>One in the New Exchange had an <hi>Aneurisma</hi> in the palm of his hand,<note place="margin">Observ. 4. <hi>Aneurisma</hi> broken open.</note> lying a-long to the third and and fourth fingers, which at last broke out, and bled at times the space of eight or ten daies, and being at a loss he sent for me, with this Tincture of Vitriol as above-said, I cured him not only by stopping the bloud, but by making a firm Cicatrix, I drest these Eruptions, but seldom once in four or five days.</p>
                     <p>A Sedentary young Gentleman of an ill habit of Body,<note place="margin">Observ. 5. Wound of the Surall Artery.</note> wounded by a puncture in the Inside of the calf of his leg into the Surall Artery, bled much, a Chirurgion is call'd for; he fills up the wound with his Dossils dipt <hi>in albumine ovi,</hi> and astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent pouders, wherein was <hi>Escarotics calchantum ustum,</hi> &amp;c. Applying over this his Emplaster and Bandage, by which he stopt the flux of bloud, and left the Patient to rest: The next day I am cal'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41836:29"/>in to dress the Patient. Upon a relation of the wound and this manner of dressing, I propose not to open the wound in four or five daies, unless some Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happen I visit him daily, he keeps his bed, complains of a disturbance in the wound, as burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, throbbing, and pain at times, not constantly, and is very apprehensive of its bleeding; looks himself often upon the Bandage, and Alarums me by messages as often. The third morning his Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion and my self meet, we find the Bandage all bloudy; we propose to dress, The <hi>Appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> being made we take off the dressings, and find the bloud fresh in the Roulers, but upon taking off the Emplaster see the Dossils come out, and with such a foul bloudy <hi>sanies,</hi> as is usual in such wounds after the filling them with such Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. I consider with my Brother Chirurgion, whether the putting in a Tent with <hi>Escarotics</hi> may not stir up flux of Humours, and be attended with Inflammation, &amp;c. and whether that way we may be sure of meeting with the Artery; and if we do whether our Medicaments will restrain its bleeding; and if not, then whether by pressing upon that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery we may not raise a flux of bloud anew? To avoid all such I resolve to dress the wound with our common digestive, with <hi>Tereb. vitell &amp; ovi</hi> with <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Galeni,</hi> and so we apply it upon a thick pledgit of Lint, and Embrocate the parts about with <hi>ol. Ros. &amp; Aceto, &amp; Empl. è Bolo</hi> over all with good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and Bandage; by this I suppos'd the parts would be at ease, the wound at liberty to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the sloughs and <hi>sanies</hi> which was made and choaked in by the last dressings; and the Unition of parts within furthered, and the bloud in the Artery restrained. If it did not thus answer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41836:30"/>yet I concluded we had done what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came good Chirurgions, and that at the next dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it would be in our power more easily to lay open the wound, and divide the Artery without hurting the nervous or tendinous bodies near it. For a wound so drest up would either unite or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late its lips, there being a pledgit proportionable to receive a small quantity of matter, such as might be expected from such a wound, well-condition'd, but a greater quantity, or a new flux of bloud that could not get out so, must necessarily distend the lips, we resolving not to dress the wound again in less than 3 or 4 daies: Thus we left the Patient easie; but the next day I found him unsatisfied how this wound could cure so dress without a Tent, and oft murmuring that it would rancle; yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued pretty easie, and did not bleed all these three dayes. The Fourth day at the opening, we found no bloud but what was mixt with matter, and the wound lookt well; but by his importunity I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with him, and put in a short Tent spread with digestive and dipt in praecipitate, and drest him up again; and the third day open'd, and upon the dressings there was a fresh bloud again, which was followed by a thick white Matter, as from a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> more than might reasonably be expected from a small puncture, not above half an Inch deep; wherefore fearing a cavous Ulcer, I resolved to dress without a Tent, and by good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and bandage to press out thit Matter from within, and defend the part from Influx of Humours from above: to which purpose I drest with pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gits as before with my digestive, &amp;c. and open'd the wound once in three dayes, and altered not this method, though I chang'd the <hi>ung.</hi> upon the pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41836:30"/>as I thought fit: Thus I kept the part without tumor or Inflammation, and the matter lessened each dressing, but was not well digested nor free from bloud, but his feet swell'd, and himself ill-disposed; <hi>Scorbutic</hi> and such like affections, with loss of Appetite, fainting, &amp;c. To relieve him in these Dr. <hi>W.</hi> was consulted, and after a while I caused a straight stocking to be laced on both legs, and got him out of Bed at least for some little while every day, and when he was able he retired into the Country, but hath not yet got off of the disease he heightned, by keeping within doors with this little wound. Doubtless this cure had been shorter, if immediately in the first dressing he had been bound up with an Agglutinative bandage, and the whole committed to nature.</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41836:31"/>take off his Arm by Amputation; We met the next morning, the Patient is taken out of bed and placed in a Chair towards the Light, one of his friends held him in the Chair: Mr. <hi>Whittle</hi> stood behind his Arm, and held his Elbow with his left hand; and with the other hand was ready to help me in the operation; Mr. <hi>L.</hi> holds the lame hand: In the first place I viewed the Arm, where finding no Gangreen according to the report of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, but rather (as I thought) an <hi>Aneuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> I made a bandage above the wound, to hinder the Influx of bloud into it: Upon this bandage Mr. <hi>Pearce</hi> made the gripe; I then untied the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature from about the wound, and found that also free from Mortification; I put my finger into it, and finding the skin made thin by distention from the bloud, I call'd for a Knife, which while I was searching in the wound, Mr. <hi>Whittle</hi> took into his hand: I prayed him to cut through the length of the hallowness. It being done, I with my finger thrust out the Grumous bloud and an Abscess from the lower part of the Arm. When I had cleared the parts more distant, which would have fallen in and blinded my Work, I then made way to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, removing from about it the clotted bloud; upon which it immediately burst out, I prayed Mr. <hi>Whittle</hi> to hold his finger upon it, he did so; then I separated it from the parts about it, and passed a crooked Needle under it; and being ready to tye it, I desired Mr. <hi>Whittle</hi> to hold off his finger, that I might be the more sure it was the Artery, upon the doing of which it spurted out: I tyed it; but in tying the Thread broke: This caused a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring in some of the by-standers, as that the Patient would die under our hands while I was endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41836:31"/>deligation, which by a new wounding of the parts would hasten Mortification and Death; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired they would continue their places, and Mr. <hi>Whittle</hi> his finger upon the Artery, that it bled not; he did so; in the while I made a strong Ligature of some twisted Threads, seared it, and put it into the eye of one of our common silver searching Probes. Gentlemen, said I, you shall see me pass this probe under the Artery, and thereby you may be assured I shall wound no parts; I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately did so and tyed the Artery, Mr. <hi>Whittle</hi> took off his finger, it bled not; then Mr. <hi>Pearce</hi> took off his hands, I then loosened the Bandage, which was all the time before under his hands, It bled no more; I told them there was more to be done in order to the binding that Artery; but in continuation of the continual Fainting of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, we would defer it to the next dressing: then calling for dressings, they brought me what was designed for Amputation, which I refused; and ordered the common digestive <hi>è Terebinth. cum Vitell. ovi,</hi> which they fetcht.</p>
                     <p>I cut off the ends of the Ligature, and dipt some of the pledgits spread with the Liniment in <hi>Galen</hi>'s powder, and applyed them next the Artery, and the rest of the pledgits dipt <hi>in ol. Ros.</hi> warm, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill'd up the wound, then Embrocated the Arm with the same oyl, and laid a <hi>Diacalcitheos</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaster over the wound and that part of the Arm, and over the hand and Arm below which was <hi>Oede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous,</hi> a mixture of <hi>Diacalcith. &amp; Paracels.</hi> Then with bandage began at the hand and rouled up the wound, and taking a turn or two there, I rouled up to the <hi>Axilla.</hi> This was the <hi>Ligatura Expulsiva,</hi> by which I proposed the thrusting back the Influx of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41836:32"/>humors, and to give strength to the inseebled Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; He being now again in his Bed, I placed his hand upon his breast in much ease to the great joy of the Patient. At the next dressing, only Mr. <hi>Whittle</hi> and the Countrey Chirurgeons were present with me, we opened the Member, found the tumor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd, the wound fresh and tollerably digested, we now passed another Ligature upon the Artery above the first, and in pulling the first to cut it off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ligatures, it broke, which was as well: We drest it up with the same digestive, only leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Powders; Embrocated and applied our Emplaster, rouled up parts as before; The next time Mr. <hi>Whittle</hi> and I undrest the member, and found the wound in a very good condition, with assured hopes of curing it in a few weeks, the Lips of the wound being more digested and contracted, we drest it up with <hi>Mund. Paracels.</hi> And now being Impatiently expected at <hi>London,</hi> with my diseased Patients, I return, leaving it to Mr. <hi>Whittle,</hi> who drest it for the space of 10. dayes, it healing up without any return of bloud; In his absence Mr. <hi>L.</hi> dresses the Patient; but whether in wiping off the knot or what else, it burst out again; Serjeant <hi>Knight</hi> came in, dresses it with <hi>Calcanth. ust.</hi> and from that time it bled no more.</p>
                     <p>The Ancient way of tying this Artery is as I have already said by tying it in two distinct places, and cutting it off between, but here the Patient often fainting interrupted us in that work, and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between saved us the labour.</p>
                     <p>The cutting in pieces the Arteries hath often been performed by me in <hi>Strumous ulcers,</hi> where they ride over the <hi>Carious bones;</hi> in doing which I never see the Artery break out in bleeding after the day I cut it.</p>

                     <p>NErves may be many wayes wounded, <hi>viz. Caesim</hi> or <hi>Punctim,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wounds of Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons.</note> the former way they are usually cut through, and then occasion no new consideration in Chirurgery, because they wholly cease from action and are irrecoverable; but when prickt by a sharp pointed weapon, which is call'd a <hi>puncture,</hi> they are much to be regarded; so also Tendons, not the small Fibres of them (which are in every wound of the fleshy parts, when they are largely cut, whence they become painful) but the main body of them, which usually make up the tail or head of a Muscle, if you would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these are wounded or not, consider the place wounded, <hi>viz.</hi> whether near the Joint, in the inside the Arm, or Leg, or the end of the Muscle, or if in the Tendinous parts of the hand or foot, whence immediately arise great pains and Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, also a contraction and hardness in the Nerve or Tendon follows. But if the Nerve be quite divided, the pain is little, a kind of Stupor or Numness, and the particular part is Lame.</p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:41836:33"/>
                     <p>The most frequent wounds of Nerves,<note place="margin">Ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of bleeding not alway from a prick of Nerve or Tendon.</note> and most to be taken care of in Chirurgery being Punctures; I shall instance in them, and chuse the most common, <hi>viz.</hi> those which are made accidentally by letting bloud: and here by the way you must take notice, that in letting bloud, sometimes the Apertion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be made when the skin, by the Bandage or position of the Arm, lies equal with the Vein, yet afterwards is not so, or the Apertion is made too small in the skin; so as part of the bloud is choakt, and lies there extravased, whence a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> is made, or it happens in those that are well Let bloud, yet through the Indisposition and ill habit of Body, the part prickt festers (as they usually say) and is a day or two after sore, and if neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected makes a <hi>Phlegmon:</hi> all these <hi>Phlegmons</hi> do Inflame and swell the part, and contract the Arm; if a Boyl in a fleshy part be painful, then much more these in the Joynts, amongst the Nerves and Tendons, and this accident hath happened to all that do use to Let bloud, whether Physicians or Chirurgeons.</p>
                     <p>This was the reason that some of our old Master Chirurgeons did after Letting bloud, always apply a pledgit of <hi>Basilicon</hi> upon the Apertion with an Emplaster over it, this breathed the part, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it from corrupting. But we by a contrary way, as by a little Compress dipt in water, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to restrain the bloud, and should be laught at if we should continue the old way of <hi>Basilicon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the time we Let people bloud, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly labouring under some great fermentation, or apprehend it so; no wonder if it sometimes fall upon the part where it was invited by bandage.</p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41836:33"/>
                     <p>I have been sent for into the Countrey to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that after a Letting bloud, was seized with a great Inflammation the whole length of the Arm, this was an <hi>Erysipelas,</hi> the Apertion in the Vein might possibly be the cause, but that place was not affected at all; Dr. <hi>R.</hi> complained once of a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon, who was so unconscionable as he said, to ask five pounds for curing an Arm he had made sore by his Letting bloud; but I hope no person is so ignorant or malicious, to impute these acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to a Puncture of the Nerve and Tendon.</p>
                     <p>But when they are really prickt, their Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,<note place="margin">Signs of a Nerve prickt.</note> as you may read in all those that have writ of them, are suddain with vehement pain, faintings, convulsions, and are attended by great defluxions; they do not terminate presently in a Suppuration with good Matter, until great Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours have been used, these yield not to the simple anodyne Cataplasme of white bread and milk.</p>
                     <p>Here are other considerations; and in the first place whether they lie open, or the Apertion in the skin over them be small, or that the Nerve or Tendon lie covered under the Membrane <hi>Adiposa;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cure.</note> if it be so, then you are to open the skin that the Medicaments may penetrate to the wounded Nerve or Tendon, and hereto those Medicaments are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which are of hot dry and subtil parts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that Ichorous water, which first affects the Nerve or Tendon, and will cause putrefaction: <hi>ol.

Sabinae &amp; Terebinth. an.</hi> ʒij. <hi>Misce</hi> or <hi>ol. Costinum, Ruthae, Sabinae, Aneth. scorpion.</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>In your Application of your Medicaments, you are to consider what degree of heat and Siccity is proper for the offended Nerve or Tendon; if in your use of these Medicaments your Patient feels not the heat of them,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> or feels it vehemently, it is then not rightly fitted; For in the former case it doth not enough dry up that <hi>sanies,</hi> or in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it doth withal inflame the part;<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> if the Patient feel the heat moderately, the medicine is good, but if from the use of the Medicine the part Itch and Smart, and the Apertion made by the Puncture gape as at first, then the Medicament is stronger than it should be; if the hardness go off and the contraction, and the orifice not too open, 'tis a good sign: if the Nerve be cut according to its length it is the least dangerous, but if transverse most dangerous, all these wounds are accompanied
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41836:34"/>with gleet and great pain which stirs up fluxion; if they yield not in their cure to such Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as have been proposed, then you are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them, to prevent convulsions, <hi>spasma's,</hi> and Gangren, after which they cure as other wounds, but do require more care in their position to keep the member steady, if it be in such a Joint where there are Nerves and Tendons, that move contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise; otherwise the member will not yield to that contraction, and become more difficult in their cure, and of less use when cured.</p>
                     <p>The Ligaments require much one method with the Tendons,<note place="margin">Cure of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments wounded, the same with Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons.</note> only your Medicaments are here to be more drying, as <hi>Euphorbium, Sulphur vivum, calx lota Tutia, &amp;c.</hi> without acrimony.</p>

In the dressing this wound there was trouble how to place these Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons; I began in taking out the loose bone, and cleansing the wound, and placing these shatter'd and overstretcht Tendons within the lips of the wound, and made my first Stitch in the middle of the wound, bringing the lips as close together as I could, then I made two stitches more, one of each side the middle

Hordei</hi> with a little <hi>crocus.</hi> Upon the Suture I sprinkled the powders of <hi>myrrhae, Aloes, Thuris, &amp; sang. dracon.</hi> and applyed the unguent mentioned in the former Chapter: then taking <hi>Bolus Armen.</hi> with some of the former Powders, made up with <hi>Alb. ovor. Acet. &amp; ol. Ros.</hi> mixed to the consistence of a <hi>mel.</hi> applyed it as a restrictive over the wound and parts about, and placed his hand again upon the <hi>ferula,</hi> with a soft folded cloath under it, bringing his fingers over the end of the <hi>ferula,</hi> that they might be in some capacity for future use: Thus having placed his hand I roul'd it upon a good compress dipt in Oxycrate, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Let him bloud, and gave him ʒ vj. <hi>syr. de me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conio</hi> in a draught of Mace-Ale for his Supper, and setled him to rest, but he slept little that night. The next day I ordered him a Clyster and a slender diet; the day after I opened his hand again, and fomented the wound and parts about with an Anodyne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, as in the former Chapter, and drest up his wound as before, Embrocating patts well about with <hi>ol. Lumbric,</hi> and applyed my <hi>Emplast. è Bolo,</hi> over the wound and adjacent parts; it digested in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41836:36"/>the declining ends a little, but continued painful, yet much more pained in the fingers: the next days dressing I cut out the stitches, and drest the wound with my digestive <hi>è Tereb.</hi> dipt in my former mentioned Balsam, and applyed a Cataplasme warm over all the wound and hand, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, and roul'd up the member again: This wound did not digest kindly, nor was it easie during the whole cure, but the Inflammation went off with the Tumor about the wounded Lips; but in the fingers and back of the hand remained an oedematous Tumor. The day following I took off the dressings, and finding the Lips which I had stitcht lye open, and a white flesh within them, I dropt in some of my Balsam warm into the wound, and fill'd the crude Lips with <hi>mer. praecipit.</hi> and laid pledgits spread with the above-mentioned unguent, with some <hi>succ. Centaur. &amp; Chelidonii,</hi> with <hi>mel Ros.</hi> boyled it gently to a good consistence, and laid the <hi>Cataplasma</hi> as before over all: Thus I deterg'd and cured this wound, sprinkling the Lips with <hi>calx lota,</hi> which cicatrized it. After this I put on a <hi>Catagmatick Emplaster,</hi> and kept the maimd hand still upon the <hi>ferula,</hi> and afterwards caused a Glove to be made to lace upon his hand and fingers, to take off that pituitous Tumor, which did accordingly answer my expectation. But his pain continued, and so weak, as he kept it upon the <hi>ferula</hi> a good while after; since the writing of this I am informed he continues in the same service, his wrist is stiff, but he drives his Coach.</p>
                     <p>A Person of a good Age and ill habit of Body walking in the street,<note place="margin">A finger bit off by a Horse.</note> passing by a Coach one of the Horses snapt off the end of his finger the Glove

This Patient kept not his house with this little hurt, but came to me to be drest once in a day or two, and sometimes drest himself, he not thinking it worth the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of diet, bleeding, or the like: one day when neither of us suspected ill he came to me, the Ulcer was crude, an <hi>Ichor</hi> dropt from it, and the part about it was blistered, I scarified the part blistered, and <hi>dabbled</hi> the wound and about with <hi>ol.

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Wounds of the Face.</head>
                     <p>A Lady was wounded down the whole length of the forehead to the Nose, and then trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse under the left <hi>Supercilium</hi> towards the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muscle, her Eye and Face much bruised. This hapned to her travelling in a Hackney Coach, upon the Jetting whereof she was thrown out of the hind-seat, against the forepart of the Coach.</p>
                     <p>At the first sight of the wound in her forehead, seeing the bone bare and her self so disturb'd, I doubted whether I should stitch it, or keep it open with dossils; but seeing no fissure or Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in that part of the bone that was bare, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the deformity in that place would be great, being the whole length and middle of the forehead, I resolved to make one stitch in the middle of the forehead to bring the lips close together; so as if any Symptome prognosticated ill, I might at pleasure by the cutting off the stitches lay it open again, but if there was no cause, then the next dressing, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by dry stitches to bring the Lips of the wound close together; the upper Eye-lid hung down upon the Eye, reaching from the Inner <hi>Canthus</hi> of the Eye more than half an Inch beyond the outward, it was bruised, excoriated, and much swell'd,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41836:37"/>not capable of the dry stitch, nor in that place of Bandage, it being all along under the Brow, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I made four stitches at such distance as they might be able to keep the Lips close together, and the last stitch towards the Temporal Muscle, I took in the piece of skin that was divided by a wound above it, as in a double Hair-lip; and over these Sutures and Wounds I sprinkled a little of these powders, <hi>Terra. Sigill. Sang. Dracon. Aloes &amp; Thus,</hi> and my Pledgits spread with <hi>Arceus</hi> his Oyntment, and over these my <hi>Empl. è Bolo,</hi> and with Compress dipt in Oxycrate, and made my Bandage over from the wound, the two heads of the Roulers meeting behind; this I did to keep the wound in the forehead from uniting too close, I still fearing some Fissure or mischief there, she complaining much of her head; I having thus drest her wounds, I caused some <hi>Aq. Ros. Rubr. cum Alb. ovi</hi> to be beaten together, and dropt in her Eye, and little foulded cloaths doubled and wet in the same to be laid over that part, and over the Cheek my <hi>Empl. è Bolo,</hi> and forbore the bleeding her that night, in consideration that <hi>nunc fluebant catamenia,</hi> and she bled the space of five miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back.</p>
                     <p>The second day after I drest her again, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing less suspition in the wound of her forehead, of fracture or fissure, I brought the Lips of that wound together with dry stitches, with a little of the powder forementioned, with the white of an Egg, and strengthened those sutures of the <hi>Supercilia</hi> by the same Medicament, lest the continual motion of the Lid should relax them, and then drest it up, and brought the Bandage now from behind, with both the heads forward, passing one by another
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41836:38"/>to bring the Lips of the wound in the forehead close together, and drest her Eye with <hi>Aq. Pomor. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> with a few grains of <hi>Vitrioll. Alb.</hi> this warm to remove the suffusion upon the <hi>Cornea;</hi> and upon her bruised cheek I applied a Cataplasme of the roots of <hi>Orpen</hi> beaten in a Mortar, with the white of an Egg.</p>
                     <p>Two days after I drest her again, and finding that the dry stitches kept those Lips of the wound close together, I cut off the other stitches from out the Lips of the wound, and drest her with my <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks</hi> composed of some of those powders fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, which supplied the place of <hi>Epuloticks,</hi> and that morning I let her bloud, taking away about 10. ounces with a rotten <hi>Serum</hi> upon it.</p>
                     <p>The next day she was purged, this was done for the carrying off the flux of humor from her Eye and Face; thus was she Cured and disposed to go out of Town, the same day seven-night she was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, she was hurt upon the Munday, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday afterward she was cured.</p>
                     <p>A Servant of the <hi>L. B.</hi> was wounded on the right Cheek, from under the Eye over the <hi>Os Zy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goma</hi> down the Muscles of the Cheeks; In clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the wound, I felt a piece of the same Bone which was cut off by a slanting blow, and hung only by some fleshy fibres in the wound; it was cut over the whole breadth of the Bone; I took it out, &amp; for that the part would not well admit of Bandage, I made two stitches in the wound, bringing the Lips even and close together; I drest this Patient as the former, and the third day after drest him again, and found his wound agglutinated; I cut out the stitches, and drest him with the same agglutinatives
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41836:38"/>as before, and the second day after I opened his wound again, and found it perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>And so I have cured all the wounds of the Face as happily; in a Hair-Lip of the Nether-Lip, I cut a little Boy (who lay in <hi>London,</hi> and lived at <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>) of about seven or eight years of Age, and cured him in ten or twelve days, though this Lip by reason of slavering, and a childish trick he had of sucking his Lips in his sleep, was the more troublesome to me; yet he is so well cured, as I believe 'tis scarce discernable.</p>
                     <p>Whilest I served amongst the <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A <hi>Dutch Hambur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> markt with a Cross on the Right Cheek.</note> where <hi>Snick</hi> and <hi>Snee</hi> was, as it were, a fashion, I had much of this kind of work, and for your diversion shall set you down one of them.</p>
                     <p>Whilest our Squadron rode at Anchor in the <hi>Groine,</hi> there came in some <hi>Hollanders,</hi> under the notion of <hi>Hamburgers,</hi> with three Ships new trim'd up for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s service; a Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swain of one of these Ships hapned in company a-shore with some of our men, after a little drink the <hi>Hollander</hi> began to speak of Religion, upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our men for their wearing a Cross, and after a little more drink became quarrelsome; and that <hi>Sacramenta</hi> he would not wear a Cross, no the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil take him, repeating this often, one of our men beat him down and fell with him, kneeling upon his breast, holding his head down, he draws out a knife sticking in his Sash, and cuts him from the Ear down towards the Mouth, then from under the Eye from that Cheek-bone to the nether-Jaw, now said he you shall wear a Cross that the Devil do not carry you away. I was sent for from the next house as a friend to the Cause, and drest him; I brought
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41836:39"/>the corners of the Wound close together and even by stitches, then a stitch in each of the slits brought the Lips of the wound together, then drest him, sprinkling a little <hi>Pul. Galeni</hi> finely powdred, which we always had in our Pockets, over this a Pledgit with some <hi>Emplastick Ʋnguent,</hi> so with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press spread with a mixture of the same pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>cum Albumine ovi</hi> over the wound, bound him up, he keeping temperate the first three days, feeding only upon Bread and Bear boiled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with a piece of Butter and a little Sugar in it: The next morning he was let bloud, and the third day after I took off the dressings, and finding the wound as it were agglutinated in the slits, I cut out the stitches, and sprinkled the wound as at first, drest him up with Pledgits and my <hi>Empl. è Bolo,</hi> with Compress and Bandage; and the second day after drest him again, and cut out all the stitches, and in a dressing or two more he was cured, the stitches brought close together, any thing of a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality without acrimony cicatrizes; these, your Suture does all it self, if the part be defended from influx of humors: The Patient was well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with his cure, though there remained some marks of a Cross.</p>
                     <p>Some of these kind of people wearing them with much pride in their Faces, as marks of their courage.</p>

Puncture of the arm.</note> was thrust into the outside of the Arm, through the <hi>Biceps</hi> with a Rapier: A Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon in the Town seeing him bleed much, stitcht the wound with the Glovers-stitch close, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied over all his restrictives, and rouled up the part well: After three or four days, the Patient belonging to our Ship, came a-board, and being in pain desired me to dress him, the Arm was swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and inflamed a little, but did not bleed. I cut the stitches open, their issued out a bloudy <hi>Sanies</hi> in some quantity, and after followed a digested Matter; by search with my Probe I found the wound wanted little of passing through; I Embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the wound, and drest it up with a short Tent with my common digestives, to see whether it would by good Bandage and the help of <hi>Sarcoticks</hi> Incarn, but it would not; whereupon I passed a <hi>Seton</hi>-needle through, and that way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the Matter, and after that Apertion was digested, I dilated it, and kept a Tent there a few days: In the while, the upper part of the wound healed up, and the wound below digested well with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41836:40"/>little Matter. I also healed it up. This I insert, not that I approve of stitching Punctures, but this way without stitching wounds, in a good habit of body, by good applications and Bandage, does sometimes agglutinate them in a few days, when drest by Tents they are of longer and difficult cure.</p>
                     <p>While I was in the King's service in the time of the War in the West-country,<note place="margin">Observ. 2. Wound in the Thigh.</note> I was fetcht to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>M.</hi> who in fighting a Duell was run through the Thigh, with a broad sword; I was also fetcht at the same time to the other, I hastily drest this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers Thigh, with Pledgits spread with my Agglu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinative, and some Astringent powders mixt with the whites of Eggs, applied it over both the orifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, bringing the Lips of them close, and with Compress and Bandage rouled it up, and left him to go to bed; from whence I went to dress the other, who had many little wounds, as his fingers, hands, and head cut. At my return I visited my Patient, whom I found in his bed with little pain: the second day after I drest him again, and finding all in good temper without pain or swelling, I drest the wounds as before; well satisfied that his wounds would heal up by agglutination, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little or no Matter, pain or swelling: If it had appeared inflamed with tumor or pain, I ought then to have kept the Orifice most distempered open; and if they had both suffered, to have kept them both open with small short Tents, drest with the common digestives, and have let him bloud, and have proceeded as in a body ill-disposed; but there was no need, there was only required a quiet position of the part which he submitted to. He
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41836:40"/>was happily cured in seven or eight days. This was truly performed by the Balsam of his bloud, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bleeding nor purging him in the time of his Cure or after.</p>
                     <p>A person wounded in the in-side of the Arm,<note place="margin">Observ. 3. A Wound in the arm.</note> the sword passing over the joynt, and through the out-side of the Arm, he was first drest by a Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon near the place where he was hurt; he bled much. The next day I opened the wound in the presence of Dr. <hi>T.C.</hi> one of the Kings Physicians, I found the wound Tented at both Orifices, the Arm swelled, and a little disturbed, as wounds in that place are subject to be, when the bloud is shut in by Tents, and not drest rationally by refrigerants and astringents, and good Bandage. The swelling most between the two orifices, and was from bloud choak'd in the part, which was now more straitned from the influx of humors, so not likely to yield to other than suppuration; yet we foment the wounded parts with discutients and dissolvents, and keep both the orifices open with small Tents dipt in the common digestive, and Embrocated about the wound with <hi>Ol. Ros. &amp; Gutt. aliquot Aceti,</hi> and over all my <hi>Empl. è Bolo,</hi> rouled it up: the third dressing there appeared bloud from that orifice in the in-side of the arm, which I fill'd with Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and a dossil upon it, then drest the parts up as before. This time I acquainted the Patient with my thoughts of opening the swelled part, between the two apertions; there being no likelihood the Matter there could discharge it self by either of these openings, yet it was not safe to heal them up, wherefore I proposed the opening of that tumor by a little Caustick, after a day or two <hi>D. C.</hi> was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41836:41"/>acquainted with it, and it was opened as was afore proposed, and a corrupt <hi>Serum</hi> was discharged: from that time I threw my Tents out of the wound, and healed them up in four or five days after, and as the <hi>Escar</hi> separated and the Ulcer digested, I cured that in few days. That the bone was bare under the tumor, may I suppose yet be felt from the Adhesion of the musculous flesh to that bone.</p>
                     <p>A person was wounded in the out-side of the Right Leg,<note place="margin">Observ. 4. Wound in the Leg.</note> below the Gartering-place, the wound running upward; after six weeks dressing by the neighbouring Chirurgeons, the part being much disturbed by a flux of humors, I am call'd in; I find the wound sinuous (some two inches) undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, and inflamed with a tumor about it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the small of the leg and foot Oedematous, the whole member so weakned by the influx of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, that it was neither able to assimulate its ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor yet to resist the crudities that fell upon it, so would be difficult to cure; as all such wounds are where the Patient is ill ordered, as to his diet and dressings in the beginning of the disease: I propose in order to the cure to dissipate this flux about the wound, and to digest the wound by Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, to mitigate inflammation, and to discuss and breath out that pituitous tumor on the foot and parts about, and with the help of good Bandage to restore the tone of the parts, and then if this sinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ulcer yielded not to agglutination, to lay it open: To which end I proposed a fomentation of <hi>Summit. Absinth. Scordii. Flor. Ros. Rubr. Chamom. Sambuci, Bacc. Myrtillor. Balaust. Nuc. Cypress.</hi> these boiled in <hi>Aq. Font.</hi> adding <hi>Vini Rubr.</hi> lb ij. and some <hi>Spir.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41836:41"/>and dress the wound with <hi>Ʋng. Basil. Mag.</hi> adding Precipitate to it, and Embrocate the parts about with <hi>Ol. Ros. cum Aceto,</hi> over this I applied <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Galeni,</hi> and over the Oedematous tumor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Empl. Diacalcith. p.</hi> ij. <hi>Empl. Stict. Paracels. p.</hi> j. and over all these a good Bandage, not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Oedematous tumor more than once a week, and then to give a breathing to the part, The wound I continued to dress daily as I had begun, and happily freed the part from inflammation and influx of humors: But the wound would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest as I desired, wherefore I laid it open a little more than an inch, and drest it up with dossils spread with the same medicament as before, and incarned and cicatrized it in three weeks or a month after, but not without some difficulty, and the help of a strait Stocking. This person had been long kept in his chamber by this wound, and now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing himself well, he rides to his Country house, unknown to me, seventeen miles off, but that night his Leg swells much, the <hi>Cicatrix</hi> scarce confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed breaks out again, with great excoriation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed redness. Thus this Gentleman returns again to his house, and sends for me. To allay this pain and inflammation, I foment the part <hi>cum decoct. Malvar. Violar. Plantag. Solan. &amp; Flor. Ros. Rubr.</hi> and laying a fine Lawn wet in a solution of <hi>Troch. Alb. Rhasis</hi> made in some of the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction. I also dress'd it with <hi>Ʋng. Alb. Camph.</hi> over this Lawn, and spread some of it upon the edges, lest the Matter should be shut in by the Lawns adhesion to the Lips, and the fretted <hi>Cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula</hi> raised more up. Thus I dress twice a-day, and keep the Leg upon the bed; after some few dressings, that the heat and acrimony were allay'd,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41836:42"/>then in the place of the former Unguent, I apply <hi>Ʋng. Tutiae Mag. Vigon.</hi> and dipt the Lawn in a decoction of <hi>Fol. Plantag. Summit. Rubi, Equiseti, &amp; Flor. Ros. Rubr.</hi> to which I added some <hi>Lapis Calaminaris, Tutiae Com. Cervi ust. &amp; Calx lota pul. ostrear. combust.</hi> this was set <hi>in Balneo,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards strained out, and applied upon Pledgits over the Lawn: Thus with much difficulty I cicatrized this wound and Ulceration, which at first possibly might have been cured by the way of our ancient Masters in few days.</p>

                     <p>WOunds of the Breast are penetrating or not, if they do penetrate, then we are to consider the depth, whether it be only between the <hi>Mediastinum</hi> in the hollow cavity of that in the lower part of the Breast, or if it pierce into the cavities of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> or what the parts are that be hurt. How the Breast is circumscribed, with the symptoms of each part when hurt, you may find in the Treatise of Gun-shot.</p>
                     <p>The signs of the wounds penetration are discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the proportion of the searching Candle or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41836:42"/>Probe, which enters into the Cavity;<note place="margin">Signs of penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wounds.</note> you may also when it penetrates the cavities of the <hi>Thorax</hi> perceive it by laying a Down-feather upon the wound, or by holding a lighted Candle near the wound, the Patient holding his breath the whilest, in this case it will move the feather or flame, if it do not blow away the one, and extinguish the other; as also the Air makes a noise in its issuing forth; sometimes it's discovered by the quantity of bloud discharged by the wound or mouth, or both with difficulty of breathing.</p>
                     <p>Wounds in the hinder part of the <hi>Thorax</hi> are reckoned dangerous by reason of the Nerves and Tendons, and if they penetrate that way,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick.</note> there is another danger from the great vessels of bloud which are nearer to the weapon in this case, than in those wounds which are made forward. Yet all wounds in the Breast are dangerous, by reason of the bloud that falls down to the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and corrupts.</p>
                     <p>If the Lungs be wounded deep amongst the great vessels, though they escape the first nine days, yet they commonly terminate in a <hi>Pthisis</hi> or <hi>Fistula.</hi>

                     <p>A Wound in the outer part of the Breast is cured as a simple wound; if it penetrate,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> you are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour first the restraining the bloud, then that the extravased bloud be discharged, and that either by the mouth by expectoration, or by the Wound, or by Urine.</p>
                     <p>The way by Urine <hi>Fab. Aq. Pend.</hi> says, is by a branch of the <hi>Azygos,</hi> which, saith he, passes near the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> by the Spine to the Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. Those that own the circulation will hardly allow of his <hi>Hypothesis;</hi> however if the matter of fact be true, that there is sometimes a discharge by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41836:43"/>Urine, which I confess I have not yet observed in my own practice, it will be reasonable to propose as he doth: In this case <hi>Diureticks,</hi> as the <hi>Decoct. Capill. Veneris, Polytrichi, Rad. Petroselini, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Apii, Faenicul. Asparag.</hi> To prevent inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>Ptisans</hi> with <hi>Ol. Sulphuris, Vitrioli,</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-creams, Emulsions, &amp;c. The Ancients gave <hi>Acetum</hi> with warm water for dissolving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete bloud, and restraining the present flux.</p>
                     <p>The second way is by Expectoration, &amp; thereto our <hi>Decoctum pectorale, Lohocs, Syr. Capell. Ven. Jujub. Glycirrhiza, Oxymel. &amp;c.</hi> whereof our <hi>Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia Lond.</hi> is full. This I have mentioned for their sakes who cannot have a Physician; but here I leave this work to them, these cures consisting much in their well ordering and prescribing internal Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and content my self in the dressing of the Wound,<note place="margin">Whether the wound is to be kept open or not?</note> as it appertains to Chirurgery. In the treating these Wounds there is a question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Wound shall be kept open, or agglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; they that are for a speedy agglutination do urge it, lest the external Air corrupt parts within, and the heat expire: they that propose the keeping them open, do design thereby a readier discharge of Matter; for, says <hi>Aq. Pendens,</hi> if the Matter be to be discharged by Urine, it must first pass into the substance of the <hi>Pleura,</hi> then into the Vein <hi>Azy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> so into the Emulgents, then to the Kidneys, and through the Ureters and Bladder. If by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration; then it must also first pass into the substance of the Lungs, then into the <hi>Aspera Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria</hi> or Weazond, from thence cought up by the Mouth.</p>
                     <p>In my practice in these Wounds of the Breast,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41836:43"/>consider the wound how it is capable of discharging the extravased Bloud and Matter, if it was inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so as that the Bloud or Matter may be there discharged, then it is to be kept open, the well-fare of the Patient depending mainly upon the well-dressing and governing it; but if it do not lye well for evacuation of that extravased bloud, then it may do hurt, so ought to be healed up.</p>
                     <p>A person of about 23. years of Age,<note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note> of a good habit of Body, wounded into the Breast, upon which followed immediately great effusion of bloud, almost to the exhausting of his Spirits. Mr. <hi>R.</hi> Chirurgeon, and my self, were presently sent for, we find him lodg'd in an Inne near <hi>Fox-Hall,</hi> we view'd his wound, it was four fingers above the <hi>Cartilago ensi-formis</hi> a little to the left side; he laboured under a small pulse, fainting of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: Dr. <hi>W.</hi> &amp; Dr. <hi>Wed.</hi> came in while we were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding dressings,<note place="margin">How to order Tents in penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wounds of the Breast.</note> the wound was large and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, we made a foft Tent with a thread fastned to it; which in these wounds you must be sure to do, lest you lose it in the body: This Tent we dipt in a mixture of a powder composed of <hi>Bol. Armen. Sang. Dracon. Thuris, Mastich, &amp;c.</hi> with a new-laid Egg and a Pledget spread with the same over all, with <hi>Empl. è Bolo,</hi> and Compress with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Bandage. The Phycisians prescribed such things as restrained the bleeding, and were proper to resolve the concrete bloud, and withall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his fainting spirits: that night he rested ill, the next day when we met, seeing him labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great difficulty of breathing, with pain above the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> his Pulse quick, little Urine, and that high, we agreed he should be let bloud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41836:44"/>which was done accordingly in the left Arm, the bloud flowed with a quick stream, we took about six or seven ounces, a meer <hi>Serum,</hi> but the Patient was relieved by it; we took off our dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings to look upon the wound, whereon we found some bloud and <hi>Sanies</hi> discharged: we then drest him with <hi>Terebinth. Lot. in Succo Lamii</hi> adding some of the former powders with <hi>Vitell. ovi,</hi> this upon a Tent as before, with an Emplaster and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage over: Thus we continued to dress him, until we see the bleeding cease. In wounds within the body, I have always endeavoured to preserve the native heat of the part, and further the discharge of Matter from within, by keeping the wound open, until it lessened, and the ill symptoms went off; but shun the casting in of liquid Medicaments which are not easily to be gotten out again, they commonly proving very destructive. Here the Physician is to act by Internals, we only to assist by keeping a way open, if it may be, for the discharge of what is extravased and corrupted within the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and commit the cure to Nature. In this Person here was a great effusion of bloud upon the receipt of the wound, and the orifice large to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the extravased bloud and Matter; the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians careful in restraining accidents, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what he laboured under; through all which our work succeeded prosperously, so as parts within united; we threw out our Tent, and by <hi>Sarcoticks</hi> cured this wound without, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was restored in few weeks to perfect health, and continues so.</p>
                     <p>Another person was wounded into the Breast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the fourth Rib on the right side,<note place="margin">Observ. 2.</note> coughed up
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41836:44"/>much bloud at times; Sir <hi>Fr.

                     <p>Another wounded in the right Breast,<note place="margin">Observ. 3.</note> coughing up much bloud, with great pain and difficulty of breathing, I took away ten ounces of bloud pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, and ordered him (it being then night) some Syrup <hi>de Meconio &amp; Jujub.</hi> in a draught of <hi>Aq. Papaver.</hi> with a few drops <hi>Sp. Sulphuris,</hi> he slept well that night; against the morning he had the <hi>Decoct. Pectorale</hi> (the hotter herbs left out) and it I sweetned with <hi>Syr. de Ros. Sic. &amp; Jujub.</hi> with <hi>Sp. Sulph.</hi> this he drank in the morning, and at other times as he listed; by his disorder, he cought up bloud at times, and I let him bloud as oft, in the while I kept his wound open and digested: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another relapse I began to be sick of him, and perswaded him to send for a Physician, Sir <hi>Ed. Graves</hi> was call'd in, who see his wound almost cured, we agreed and let him bloud: and from that time he continued well.</p>
                     <p>A person run through the Body the breadth of three fingers under the right Clavicle,<note place="margin">Observ. 4.</note> and out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Scapula,</hi> was first drest by the Chirurgeon near the place where he was wounded: I found him in his bed faint and weak, but without pain or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, Dr. <hi>Bacon</hi> his Physician: The next day I met him and Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> Chirurgeon to his Highness Pr. <hi>Rupert.</hi> The patient had rested very
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41836:45"/>ill the preceding night, had bled from his wound in his back through the bed, and fowled many Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins that night in coughing up bloud, we took off the dressings from the wound in his Breast, from whence there was bloud discharged, and more came out in the dressing: I drest up the wound with a short Tent dipt in a little <hi>Terebinth.</hi> with <hi>Farina Volatilis,</hi> a few of our Agglutinative pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>cum Vitello ovi,</hi> with an <hi>Empl. Diacalcith.</hi> over it; the other wound under the <hi>Scapula</hi> was painful, but so small as it was not reasonable in our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to keep it open; we laid a Pledgit of the same mixture with an Emplaster upon that, and drest it no more; this method of dressing I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and let the Patient bloud: The third day he coughs up bloud, and some little issued from his wound for a few days; after four or five days I waited upon him to his lodgings in <hi>London,</hi> by the way he cought some bloud, and so more or less day and night; but by the care of his Physicians it lessened, his wound digested, and I now kept in it a hollow Tent made of a <hi>Sparadrap,</hi> which was composed of <hi>Resina, pini, Gum. Amoniac. Bdelli. Galb. Terebinth. &amp; Cora,</hi> with <hi>Pul. Ireos,</hi> dipt in a little <hi>Mel. Ros. Rubr.</hi> This way of dressing I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until the coughing of bloud diminished from twelve Napkins in a day and night, to ten, eight, seven, four, two, one, and but one Napkin in a week, and after that in a weeks space I see no bloud one way or other, nor any symptom of ill. I then call'd in his Physicians together, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and had all their positive judgments for throwing out the Tent, and healing up the wound: I did so, and in a week more cured him; five days after, or thereabouts, he sent me his thanks by his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41836:45"/>servant; and within few days after I made him a visit, and there met Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> who enquiring of me whether his wounds were cured, I desired that person that he would shew the Doctor whether they were or not, he presently stript himself of his shirt, and shewed the Doctor, who both see and felt their scars, and replied they are well.</p>
                     <p>A young man wounded in the Breast,<note place="margin">Observ. 5.</note> labouring under very great pain and difficulty of breathing, with a cough, sent for me late one night, he shewed me some little bloud he had then cought up: he had been wounded the night before by a man stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a door some steps higher than himself, as it were over him, thrusting his Rapier from within the breadth of two fingers of the right Clavicle downward into the Lungs, the Patient run into that house bleeding much, and was seised with such difficulty of breathing, as he was forced to stretch his arms at length over his head, without which doing he could not breathe; he had been let bloud twice, and prescribed <hi>Ptisans,</hi> &amp;c. But for all this he was little relieved, I presently let him bloud about ten ounces, and ordered the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary to give him a draught of <hi>Aq. Papaver.</hi> with <hi>Syr. de Meconio &amp; de Ros. Siccis,</hi> with a little <hi>Aq. Cordial. frig. Sax.</hi> and against the next morning to send for a Physician to meet me, they did so; when I came in the morning, I found the Patient marvellously relieved, and resolved to remove his lodging, which was now by <hi>Scotland-yard</hi> to his own in <hi>Wildstreet:</hi> in the presence of his Physician Dr. <hi>St.</hi> I took off the dressings, found his wound small and shut up from within, but not skin'd, and if it had not, yet the wound within
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41836:46"/>was so much below this without, as it was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of discharging the Matter: So this was not worth my attendance, the wound within was the work of the Physician, however he continued me with his Physician, and we agreed to bleed him again; we did so, taking away about ℥ viij. of bloud, and the Physician proceeded by Clysters and Internals proper in his case: That afternoon the Patient, unknown to me, pursued his intention of removing to his old lodging in <hi>Wild-street,</hi> where going up three pair of stairs to his chamber, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapst into the former difficulties of breathing with pain and coughing bloud, and in the morning after where I met his Physician, the Patient seemed to me quite tired, labouring under great oppression; and by his pains about the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> and Back there was suspition of extravased bloud; to relieve him there was a necessity of taking away a little bloud; we took away some four or five ounces, and proceeded with Embrocations, Lohocs, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Decoctions, &amp;c. and got off this difficulty in five or six days, then I left him: But after that, by disorder he relapst again, and was freed again the same way by his Physician, and since holds well, but I never see him since.</p>
                     <p>Of all these wounded Patients, and many more I have helpt to cure,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation concerning the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the <hi>Sanies</hi> of the Breast by Urine.</note> I never see one that I could say passed their disease by Urine, nor many of them that passed their Urine well during the time of their lying under these wounds; nor have I often seen them who recover, expectorate any such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Matter, as might be thought to proceed from the great quantity of bloud extravasated: They cough fresh bloud most of them, like to what
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41836:46"/>they discharge from their wounds, but more florid.</p>
                     <p>Those who do cough great quantity of Matter from these wounds made by a sharp Weapon, or avoid it by their wounds, do seldom well: They usually terminate in a <hi>Tabes,</hi> with or without a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stula:</hi> Yet by the ninth day one may truly predict their present recovery, if all things have been rightly administred.</p>

Then they leaving his Hips high, and he declining with his body on the Right side, by the help of one pressing with his hand a little above the wound (by which the Lips of the wound were a little turned upward, and the <hi>viscera</hi> kept down;) I with a strong Needle a little crookt at the point with a strong Thread seared take hold of that lower lip,<note place="margin">Manner of sewing the <hi>Peritone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> in this case.</note> and near the end past my Needle first through the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and then on the opposite side through the flesh and skin, leaving the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and so go along passing the Needle from without Inward, till I

These wounds are not subject to great Inflammation or defluxion, but by reason of the fatness and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Lips, and manner of sewing, 'tis a troublesom work; and yet if they be not so stitcht as the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> and fleshy parts may unite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, a Rupture follows to the great trouble of the Patient, and shame of our profession: the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> bears a great stress, therefore you must be sure to take good hold with your stitches,

The Hairy Scalp is thinnest on the top of the Head, nor is there any Muscle between it and the Skull in that part, unless you will call the <hi>membrana carnosa</hi> a Muscle, (which some men of late do, and possibly not improperly;) and here the rather, because by it many men move the whole Scalp. If you doubt of a fracture there, you may boldly cut into the Hairy Scalp, it is of an obtuse sense and easily healed up again.<note place="margin">Forehead.</note> But be cautious how you make your Incision in the forehead, where a transverse Incision may cause the Eye-brows to fall over the Eyes; therefore if you are forced to make Incision, let it be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the length of the Fibres, and avoid the <hi>vena frontis,</hi> lest its bleeding disturb your work. And be careful that you make no Incision upon the Temporal Muscles,<note place="margin">Temporal Muscle.</note> for thereby Convulsions and other ill Accidents may happen.</p>
                     <p>Under the Hairy Scalp lyes the <hi>Pericranium,</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Cranium</hi> follows,<note place="margin">Cranium and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> which is a Bone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of many joyned together by Sutures, of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41836:50"/>which there are five concern us <hi>Coronalis, Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doides, Sagittalis,</hi> &amp;c. two false ones. In perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the <hi>Cranium,</hi> you are to shun these, (if you may) for through them the <hi>dura mater</hi> passes, being continued unto the <hi>Pericranium.</hi> The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures divide the Bones of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> by which one part of the <hi>Cranium</hi> may be preserved entire while the other is broken, which otherwise would be in hazard; These Sutures are weak in resisting Blows, and upon them also Matter may be easily contracted and make a <hi>Caries</hi> the sooner, and sooner worke through to the brain than in either parts of the Skull. It is necessary to know them well, lest as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> well cautions, you take them for Fissures.<note place="margin">The way to find the Sutures.</note> The way of finding them is, by passing one string from ear to ear, and another from the Nose to the Crown of the head; the former of these shews you the Coronal Suture, the second the Sagittal, which usually begins at that point where these lines intersect, being the part where we make <hi>Fontanels,</hi> and reacheth to the Crown of the head where the <hi>Lambdoides</hi> begins; sometimes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth quite at the Nose. The <hi>Lambdoides</hi> begins at the end of the Sagittal, and goeth forked down the two sides of the <hi>occiput:</hi> of the <hi>Suturae nothae:</hi> the two chiefly to be regarded are the <hi>Squamosae,</hi> which run under the temporal Muscle of each side, round about the outermost verge of the ear.</p>
                     <p>You are also to take notice that the <hi>Cranium</hi> is thinnest in the middle part of the head,<note place="margin">Thickness of the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</note> and thickest in the hinder part, and of a middle thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the fore part: Hence it is that wounds are most dangerous in the Crown of the head, where the Skull by reason of its Tenuity easily communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates its hurt to the brain, and also for that the upper
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41836:50"/>part of the brain lyes there high, one of the largest <hi>Sinus</hi> being immediately under the Skull, and many Capillary veins running so close with it, as to make themselves Trenches in the Internal part of the <hi>Cranium:</hi> Wherefore upon a blow or concussion in this place, the veins may easily be broken, and the bloud extravased between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>dura mater,</hi> and ill Accidents follow.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>dura mater,</hi> a strong Membrane,<note place="margin">Dura ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> is placed under the <hi>Cranium,</hi> which being wounded is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended frequently by Palsies, and in progress of the distemper by Convulsions and other ill Symptoms; and the greater if wounded in the middle part of the head according to its length, there being many Vessels, which if they chance to be cut, will fill the vacant space between the <hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>dura mater</hi> with bloud.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pia mater</hi> lies upon the body of the Brain so close,<note place="margin">Pia mater.</note> that a wound cannot be made into the <hi>Pia mater</hi> and the Brain escape; and from its many veins a flux of bloud must follow.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41836:51"/>But if none of these were, you may then <hi>dubitare an os fractum,</hi> doubt whether the Bone be broken: then it is to be considered, whether it was Stone, Iron, or Lead, that he was hurt withal, and with what force the Blow was given. But if there be a wound, nothing is more sure than the finger or Probe; if it feel smooth or slippery, the <hi>Cranium</hi> is safe: But if you feel any Asperity or roughness, if it be not the Suture, then you may be assured of a Fissure or Fracture, the holding a Tread between the Patients Teeth, or biting of a Crust, is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as a sign of a Fracture, but this way is very uncertain: To find hair cut in a wound may be a sign, if you consider, no small force will cut a hair there.</p>
                     <p>If by your Probe you make no discovery of the fissure, and yet the Symptomes be grievous, then lay it open, and if the Fissure do not then appear, rub the bared <hi>Cranium</hi> with Ink, and wiping it off again, you will see the Ink remaining only in the Fissure or crack, then <hi>Rugine</hi> it.</p>

In the middle of the head most dangerous, the hinder part least dangerous, the fore part of a mediocrity between both, it having passages near for discharge of its bloud and matter: Wounds of the Sutures are dangerous, but those are more or less as they fall into good or bad Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons hands, and as the Patient submits to the method of cure. A simple wound by a Blow hath been through ill Chirurgeons, &amp;c. the cause of much danger, that in skilful hands would easily have been cured: All wounds save those of the Brain are curable, if the Chirurgeon be timely call'd in, and that it be discovered in such place where he may lay open safely.</p>

                        <hi>Fallopius</hi> tell us, that where the <hi>Cranium</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tused, certain spots will appear red, not unlike those white ones which are seen in the nails of the fingers; but after the third day the bloud exhales, and that redness ceaseth: If by the former you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the fissure, or that the bone be contused, you are to <hi>Rugine</hi> the contused bone, and the whole length of the fissure; To which purpose and for that use to supply your self with various forms of <hi>Rugines:</hi> Whilest you are working with them, the lips of the wound are to be covered, that neither you hurt them, nor the Air offend them; sometimes these very small fissures, how inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable soever they may seem, are the cause of the Patients death, there being often found extravased bloud upon the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> the Veins being broken either by the concussion from the blow, or by the rough edges of the inner table next the Membrane: Therefore you are to consider the symptoms, and accordingly lay open either by <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines</hi> or cutting into it, so as the <hi>Sanies</hi> may be discharged, and the Asperity taken away: But if there be a fracture of the <hi>Cranium</hi> in one or both tables with a depression of the bone and a fissure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,<note place="margin">Depressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which often happens, you are presently to make a way to relieve the Membranes underneath, for they cannot be without great disturbance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and a putrifaction will follow, whence those symptoms of Fever, <hi>Delirium, Coma,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, Palsies, and Death ensue, if neglected. In this case you are to consider, whether the fissure do discharge the serous bloud or <hi>Sanies,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by cutting that fissure open, the deprest and fractured bone may not be raised up; if it may, then you are to proceed by inlarging that fissure,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41836:56"/>and there with your <hi>Levatory</hi> raise up the deprest bone, and remove the fragments, and cleanse the membrane from the Raspings or ought else hath soiled it: But if the fracture doth not penetrate so far into the bone, nor there be any such depression or fear that <hi>Sanies</hi> is detained underneath, then you ought not to perforate the bone, nor expose the membrane to the Air, or more than is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in this your eye and symptoms will guide you.</p>
                     <p>In order to perforation of the <hi>Cranium,</hi>

                     <p>If after this the membrane be fouled by the saw-dust, from the bone you are to wipe it off with a little Lint upon your Probe; the part cleansed, you are to dress the membrane:<note place="margin">First dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing after perforati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> About this first Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation Authors differ, <hi>Avicen</hi> drest the Patient with Lenients, as <hi>Ol.

Ros. Spir. Vini,</hi> and higher detergents are to be used, as the putrifaction is more or less. If there be much bloud extravased, or that you fear bleeding, that of <hi>Celsus</hi> may be proper; but if the bloud exceed not in quantity as it seldom doth, and if it be recent, it possibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from some scratch of your <hi>Terebra</hi> or little asperity of the inner bone or Table, or if there be neither of these, but the membrane fresh, and of its natural colour, then you are not to grieve that membrane, new exposed to the Air with deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, nor by the Acrimony of the Vinegar; for if you shall by scratching of the membrane make it bloudy, and then dress it with either <hi>Acetum</hi> or <hi>Mel. Ros. &amp; Spir. Vini,</hi> you shall then proceed
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41836:57"/>contrary to the common Indications in Chirurgery, which teacheth to digest recent wounds before you deterge: And indeed what would you deterge?</p>
                     <p>Therefore I do propose to you Lenients, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Authority of those Ancients and Moderns, but by my own Practice. <hi>Galen</hi> proposed <hi>Sang.

                        <note place="margin">Observ.</note> a day or two before the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, a Gentleman attended the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a large wound cut with a sword to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> he had no other dressings on but a Linnen cap, the membrane covered with the shivers of the bone, it had not been drest, and may be the better for him, for if dossils in haste had been prest in the wound, he would have laboured under some severe symptoms; but the shivers lay loose upon the membrane, and he felt not his danger. I took
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41836:58"/>these lightly out, cleansed the wound, and drest him up with lenients, the short time we were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Authors have set us a limited time to dress with this or that Medicament, as to the fourth day so, and from that to the seventh to deterge, and so the fourteenth day <hi>Sarcoticks,</hi> but herein you must make use of your own judgments, persisting to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish the native heat of the part.</p>
                     <p>If the wounds penetrate to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> you must consider the sorce of the Weapon, and make haste to relieve the parts under the <hi>Cranium.</hi>

These bones are to be hastened out with as much speed as may be, and the part afterwards drest with Lenients, as hath been said: If the opening in the fractured <hi>Crani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> be not sufficient, make one in the most decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part, and raise up the bones, and free the membranes of whatever may offend it, but do not take out more bones than needs must, like some of those Chirurgeons I have met carrying them about, boasting in that which was their shame; for these bones in recent fractures do unite as those in other parts, therefore having raised them up, dress them lightly with the <hi>Catagmatick</hi> powders, and they will happily agglutinate and make your cure more facil. In these wounds of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> the lenients of <hi>Ol. Ros.</hi> or warm Pigeons-bloud are

Cort. Granat. Balaust. Ros. Rubr. Alum. ust.</hi> with a soft dossil and compressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Bandage, will be taken down, or if it grow very big by ligature it is taken off: But to tell you truly, I never met with any such like disturbance as is represented to us by Authors, nor shall you, if you use your desiccants timely: The Vitriol or Allom-stone insensibly takes this off, and disposes the part to cicatrize if daily used.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Pia Mater</hi> is a most delicate fine membrane, and adheres so close to the brain, that it can scarce be wounded without a wound in the Brain; and these are most commonly mortal, for that it is full
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41836:59"/>of Veins, and subject to great effusion of bloud; the Brain wounded and exposed to the Air corrupts by reason of the external cold which soon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes the little heat of this part. And by reason of the fluidity of the Brain, and contraction of the <hi>Meninges</hi> (or membranes) caused by the constant pain and irritation, the brain perpetually ouseth out upon you, till the whole wounded <hi>Lobe</hi> be spent. You must make way to these wounds by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the shattered flesh and extraneous bodies and bones: but if they will not come easie away, leave it to nature, lest he die under your hands, and you be thought to hasten his death. Your dressings must be with <hi>Galen</hi>'s powder, with Hares Furre, with the white of an Egg to restrain the bleeding, and retain the brain within its bounds, and over them your dressings, as in the wounds of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and over the wound digestives; remembring in all these Gun-shot wounds to cut off the shattered lips of the <hi>Calvariae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Note.</note> lest a Gleet drop from them upon the <hi>Meninges</hi> and brain, and heighten the inflammation: If the brain be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within its membranes <hi>Pia &amp; Dura Mater,</hi> and they digest and incarn, then you are to proceed in the rest of the cure as in fractures of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> as hath already been said.</p>
                     <p>In all hurts of the head what sort soever they be of, the Body is to be emptied, and the rather,<note place="margin">Internal medicines.</note> if there be <hi>Plethora</hi> or <hi>Cacochymia;</hi> for in such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of body humors are apt to stir up ill symptoms, especially if the wound be great; therefore you are the first day to open a Vein in the Neck or Arm on the same side, and bleed according to the exigency and strength of body; also cupping with scarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Neck and Shoulders, with Fontanels
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41836:60"/>under the Ears is necessary: Then Lenient medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, such as may evacuate the serous bloud, which by reason of its tenuity and heat readily flies to the affected part.

All the while they carried him and were making him unready, he roared and was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly, especially whilest they were pulling off his Stockings from his right Leg, which inquiring more particularly into, we found broken short in the middle of the Thigh-bone,<note place="margin">A great Bony Wen.</note> close by a Bony wen of the bigness of a Tennis-ball; they put him into Bed, and we prepared dressings for setting and reducing the fracture, he opposed us mainly in the Setting and dressing it up, but some of the people holding him down in his Bed, we set and drest his Leg as is said in the Lecture of simple Fractures; but he was no sooner at liberty, than he endeavoured to loose the Bandage which we had put on for keeping the Fractured bones toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and would not be quiet until he had done it. We contented our selves in what we had endeavoured, and from that time left his Leg to lye unset or drest, not so much as an Emplaster over it, and prepared the application for his head, shav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hair from that side of the Temporal Muscle, and Embrocated the part which seemed to us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, <hi>cum oleo &amp; Aceto,</hi> and applyed a Cataplas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma of Bean-meal which was speediest to be had, and with <hi>aceto &amp; mel. &amp; oleo,</hi> and four whole Eggs, which he permitted patiently. That bound on, I left my Brother Chirurgeon to stay with him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>London:</hi> The next day, Sir <hi>T. B.</hi> sent for Sir <hi>Ch. Scarborough,</hi> and carried us with him to <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi> where we found the Patient raving as by their report, he had done all night. We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not one word he spake, his pulse was now
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41836:66"/>intermitting, no Indication for bleeding, what was necessary for him to take the Physician then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and concluded that there was no Indication to do more at present; his bruise was upon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Muscle, a part not to be laid open, upon a bare surmise, nor shall I ever allow the laying it open though a Fissure were under it, but content my self, as <hi>Ambr. Par.</hi> did in such like cases, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen above it, and make discharge that way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we renewed our Embrocations and Cataplas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and continued to dress his head daily as hath been said in Concussions: Then we left the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon to wait upon the Patient; Sir <hi>Ch. Scarborough</hi> was going a journey farther into the Countrey, I to <hi>London,</hi> but with promise to return daily to this Patient while he lived. I did so, and the next day finding the Patient raving as I left him, his pulse troubled and intermitting, I resolved to attempt a doubtfull remedy rather than suffer him so to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and that was bleeding him: his distemper proceeding from Inflammation of the Membrains of the Brain, the oppression was certainly there; to which purpose I let him bloud from the same Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar about Ten ounces, and so proceeded every day or second day at least. The Patient bare it well, and seemed to be relieved, his pulse rising upon it, and he slumbring sometimes, and taking his nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which before he did not; about the 17 day I coming to him near <hi>Totenham</hi> met his Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going to <hi>London,</hi> he told me that if he had met me at the Patients Lodging, we might have set his Leg, he being now more sensible of the Fracture. I perswaded him back, much rejoycing to hear that the Patient was so well; but when I came near his Chamber I heard him hollowing. It troubled
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41836:67"/>me what to do, I knew his bleeding had much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him, but the People as also the Chirurgeon disliked my so often Letting him bloud, and did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busively say, Now you shall see this Chirurgeon Let him bloud again, and that I would be the death of the Gentleman; however I resolved to Let him bloud once more, and no more. This I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared with the necessity of doing it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly opened the same Vein again, and held a white stone Porringer to receive the bloud, which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a sprightly stream, the Patient lying as quietly the while upon his back, I put the Porrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into Mr. <hi>Turners</hi> hand, and seeing the bloud flow with much vigour, I catcht up hastily a pewter Porringer, proposing to take a little in that. In bleeding these Veins in the Neck, we usually hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Poringer close to their Neck it serves us as a Bandage to intercept the descent of the bloud. I put this Porringer into my brother Chirurgeons hands, with pretence to make a dressing to lay upon the Vein, but stood at a little distance, looking my Patient in his Face, with a resolution to bleed him until I saw his Countenance change; which I did, and then stept to the Patient to stop the Vein: The while the Porringer was taking away, the bloud run out of the Porringer, it having been melted in the side, and the hole so covered by the Sawder as I did not see it before; in the while he was bleeding I thought him long in bleeding, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to see so little quantity gathered from so full a Stream, and now seeing the bed so bloudy, it was evident that when the melted hole prest not against his Neck, the bloud ran into the bed which deceived me. But the Patient upon the taking a little of his Cordial Julip, refresht his Spirits, I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41836:67"/>sat a while by him, and left him pretty hearty. The next day I returned sooner than I used to do, being doubtful how I should find him, but to my wonder, he was perfectly well in his Sences, and discoursed soberly of what passages he remembred in the time of his <hi>delirium.</hi>

                        <p>We presently prepared now to set this fractured thigh bone, after it had lain 17 daies unset, it was without Inflammation Tumor or pain. The <hi>Callus</hi> I suppose was thrust out at the ends of the bones, and that had covered the Asperity of the fractured ends of them; as the large bleeding and disease had made revulsion and evacuation. We by an easie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension brought the ends of the bone together, and drest it up as I usually do in simple fractures, and in less than twenty daies the <hi>Callus</hi> was dryed, and his Leg so strong as to bear him again, and some weeks after he went abroad about his Affairs.</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41836:68"/>the deprest bone. Upon the raising this <hi>Calvaria</hi> upwards toward the Coronal Suture, I espied a fissure running up from the fractured Bone beyond my first Incision; wherefore I followed the fissure laying it open the whole length near to the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Suture, out of which I see a serous bloud flow in a good quantity, by which I promised my self a suddain remission of these Symptomes which the child laboured under. The depression was a piece of bone as broad as a three pence sunk in below the first Table: I fill'd up the opening with dossils of dry Lint, and applyed over all my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestive, <hi>è Terebinth. vitel. ovi</hi> upon pledgets with <hi>Empl. è Bolo,</hi> and made a Bandage to keep my dressings on, after I had Embrocated parts about with <hi>ol.

Here in this wound, I also cut that Vein, which in the former discourse I gave you caution to avoid, which could not be here, the fracture being just under it, and in such cases even the Artery it self is not to be spared. The <hi>Terebra</hi> set on, the bone taken out, and the inner edges smoothed by the Lenticular Instrument I put in a <hi>Levator,</hi> and raised up the deprest bone even with the rest: That done I placed in a <hi>Syndon</hi> with a bit of Thread or Silk fastened to it, first dipt in <hi>ol.

What concerned Internals Dr. <hi>Barwick</hi> took care of, the other Physicians and Chirurgeons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more; I continued the same method in my dressing until digestion, which was made in 4 or 5 days, then I added <hi>Mel.

Going presently out of this close room, where I was crouded up with great lights burning near me, into the fresh Air, I burst out with a violent coughing of bloud, but the

From the first opening there came no more any of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons; I retained the Chirurgeon that had first drest him in his little wound, he dwelling near the Patient.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41836:72"/>and do that by an Emplaster, which in others we do with a Knife: To which purpose I applied my Ung. <hi>Catheraet.</hi> and with an Emplaster over it, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound up her Childs head, and carried it home: And about two hours after I call'd to see the Child, and found it had been very easie, these parts being of an obtuse sense, and the less sensible for that the skin was distended by the Matter; I took off the <hi>Empl.</hi> and found it had workt well, I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and discharged about three or four spoonful of a filthy <hi>Sanies;</hi> I took off this Caustick the sooner here, suspecting lest it should by longer ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penetrate through, and by its salts offend the parts within: Upon dividing this <hi>Escar</hi> the bone was seen bare, and by a Probe I felt it to the whole length; upon which I cut it open, and afterward a-thwart over, and then by turning the <hi>Escar</hi> aside, I see a long fissure the whole length of the Tumor, running transverse over from the Temporal Muscle backward, the Skull very thin, yielding to the least pressure of my finger, as a piece of Vellum, so as I might have inlarged it with my Knife if I had thought it necessary. I laid the Childs head upon one side and dropt in a little <hi>Mel. Ros.</hi> with a little of my Tincture of <hi>Myrrhe, Aloes,</hi> &amp;c. as prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in this Treatise, and with Pledgits dipt in the same, lightly covered up the same bone, and with Pledgits dipt in <hi>Basilicon.</hi> with a little <hi>Ol. Lilior.</hi> and a little <hi>Ol. Terebinth.</hi> drest up the <hi>Escar,</hi> and laid a Cephalick Emplaster over all, and bound up her head, and thus drest her daily, sprinkling my Cephalick powder upon the bone for the space of many days. I see pieces of the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> purge out, and hang in the fissure, and for some while a thin <hi>Ichor</hi> came out of the fissure; the <hi>Escar</hi> sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41836:73"/>I drest the lips with <hi>Mund. Paracels.</hi> and the bone with my linement <hi>Arcei,</hi> dropping into the fissure the Balsam prescribed for these wounds by <hi>Vigo, pag.</hi> 105. Thus I proceeded, and happily cured this Child: The Tumor behind the Ear and part about I Embrocated with <hi>Ol. Ros.</hi> warm daily, by which that Tumor went off, it arising from this of the fissure; but about a year after this Child grew lame of her left Leg, and was strumeous: How I proceeded in this you may read in the Treatise of that disease, she being the product of a diseased Mother.</p>

                        <head>An Additional discourse of Wounds of the Brain.</head>
                        <p>THE greater symptoms that are usually said to attend the Wounds of the Brain,<note place="margin">Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in Wounds of the Brain.</note> do shew themselves more uncertainly than a speculative Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon would imagine. And in Cuts or Wounds made by sharp weapons, or sudden strong force more uncertainly than in Contusions, Concussions, &amp; Depressions of the Skull. The highest of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Vomiting, <hi>Stupor,</hi> loss of speech, with a <hi>Paralysis</hi> of Legs and Arms arising more suddenly in these latter cases, than in the former. These symptoms have appeared in one of the forementioned Observations, where there was nothing of fissure or extravased bloud seen upon the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> after the Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration or Perforation of the <hi>Cranium.</hi> Nay, we see many die suddenly from a box of the Ear, and from small blows or wounds: In some upon open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Cranium</hi> there is much bloud extravased, in others none at all, or ought else that may be thought to have kill'd the Patient.</p>
                        <p>A Young man from a blow with a Cudgil upon the forehead, presently takes his bed, becomes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirous, a <hi>Sopor</hi> follows, and after some days he dieth. I am sent for to see his head opened; in laying open the forehead, I see a small hair-like fissure, running from the great <hi>Canthus</hi> of the eye upward: we took off the skull and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and found but little bloud extravased, the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> as little
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41836:75"/>altered. Others I have been call'd to see opened, where there had preceded only a contusion of the <hi>Calvaria,</hi> without fissure or extravased bloud, more than is usually seen in every opening, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the <hi>Cranium:</hi> yet the Patient lay, as I am informed, under all those symptoms of <hi>Delirium, Coma,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Then again I have drest many that have been cut through the skull, the shivers of bones and pasht flesh, and hair lying upon the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> yet the Patient without any symptom of such a wound; some whereof you have read of in this preceding Discourse,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> some other I shall instance. At <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> Mr. <hi>John Chace</hi> was present, when a poor Servant-maid came to me to be drest of a wound she had received on her head by a Musquet-shot, in the taking of <hi>Calander-house</hi> by the enemy; there was a fracture with a depression of the Skull: I set on a <hi>Trepan</hi> for the elevation of the deprest bone, and for discharge of the <hi>Sanies:</hi> She had laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this fracture at least a week before she came to me; yet had none of those symptoms afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but after perforation, and raising up this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest bone, and dressing the wound, she went her way, and came daily thither to be drest, as if it were only a simple Gun-shot wound of the hairy scalp: Mr. <hi>Penycuke</hi> an eminent Chirurgeon of that Nation did assist me in this work; I think the Brain itself was wounded: I left it in his hands, who I suppose finished the cure.</p>
                        <p>At the beating up of some of our out-guards near <hi>Truro,</hi> the enemy pursuing them, a Trooper wounded between the Right Brow and Ear, on the <hi>Sinciput;</hi> espying me amongst the flying croud, importuned me earnestly to dress him; he would
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41836:75"/>admit of no excuse, we stopt at an Apothecaries house on the right hand, going out of the Town towards <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi> I call'd to the Apothecaries servant to bring some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to dress him,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in the while hastily I lifted up the bloudy hair, and see a quantity of the Brain lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong it, I took it up with my fingers, and shewed it him, the sight whereof calmed his passion, whereby I had liberty to fly from the Enemy who was entred the Town. Here the Prognostick was certain, yet none of those cruel Symptoms which accompany Concus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions or lesser fissures.</p>
                        <p>From Battails and Sieges of Towns and Garisons, we meet with many such wounds;<note place="margin">Manner of dressing the Brain.</note> in them we hasten our way to the Extraction of the Extraneous bodies, by cutting off the shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>calvaria</hi> first, then pulling out what ever was carried within the <hi>Cranium;</hi> if this be well perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we then dress up the Brain and Membranes with a <hi>Sindon</hi> of Silk or soft linnen, of a bigness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the wound; this is dipt in a warm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestive, such as is proper for the wounded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, for however Chirurgeons have proposed to dress the Brain with one kind of Medicaments, and the Membranes with another, that is not possible to be so done, but that the Membranes or <hi>Meninges</hi> will be washt with the same Medicaments, and if they be offended by that Acrimony, Inflammation, Fever, Delirium and death will the speedier follow: In the Cure of these wounds of the Brain, I do consider the Brain as an Insensible body, and that their cure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in keeping it within its Membranes, and dressing them as wounds of the Membranes with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nients, &amp;c. if this can be done, as in small wounds of the Brain it doth sometimes happen, (and the better if the fracture of the Skull hath not been very large,) then the Patient may recover.</p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:41836:76"/>
                        <p>But if the fracture in the Skull be large, and the wound in the Brain proportionable, that the Brain cannot be contained within, then it corrupts by the external cold, and gets between the <hi>Meninges,</hi> and offends them by its putrid Acrimony, whence Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, Palsies, and other ill accidents follow, and death. They sometimes live until that <hi>Lobe</hi> be consumed, or hath wrought it self forth; as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</p>
                        <p>At the Siege of <hi>Mellcome Regis,</hi> a foot-souldier of Lieut.<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Coll. <hi>Ballards</hi> by the grazing of a Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, had the fore-part of his head carried off, and the Skull fractured into many pieces, driving some of it with the hairy Scalp into the Brain: The man fell down as dead, but after a while moved, and an hour or two after his fellow Souldiers seeing him endeavour to rise, fetcht me to him. I pull'd out the pieces of bones, and lacerated flesh from amongst the brain, in which they were intangled, and drest him up with soft folded linnen dipt in a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick Balsam, with <hi>Empl.</hi> and Bandage bound him up, supposing I should never dress him any more. Yet he lived 17. days; and the 15. day walkt from that great corner Fort over against <hi>Portland</hi> to the Bridg, which separates <hi>Waymouth</hi> from <hi>Mell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Regis,</hi> only led by the hand of some one of his fellow Souldiers; the second day after he fell into a <hi>Spasmus</hi> and dyed,<note place="margin">N. B.</note> howling like a dog, as most of those do who have been so wounded.</p>
                        <p>About the same time a maid servant was shot into the right side of the <hi>Sinciput</hi> by a Musket bullet deep into the Brain, she lived as long, <hi>viz.</hi> until the <hi>Lobe</hi> of the Brain was wrought out or corrupted.</p>
                        <p>At the Seige of <hi>Taunton</hi> one of Coll. <hi>John Arundell</hi>'s men in Storming the Work was shot in the face by Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41836:76"/>he fell down as dead, and in their retreat was carried off amongst the dead, and laid into an empty house by the way until the next day, when in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing early the Coll. marching by that house, heard a knocking within against the door, some of the Officers desiring to know who it was, lookt in, and saw this man standing by the door without Eye, Face, Nose or Mouth: The Coll sent to me, (my quarters being nearest) to dress the man, I went, but was somewhat troubled where to begin; The door consisted of two hatches, the uppermost was open, and the man stood leaning upon the other part of the door which was shut, his Face with the Eyes, Nose, Mouth, and forepart of the Jaws, with the Chin was shot away, and the remaining parts of them driven in: one part of the Jaw hung down by his Throat, and the other part pasht into his Throat; I see the Brain working out from under the lacerated Scalp from both brows, I could not see any advantage he could have by dressing, to have cut away the lacerated parts here, had been to expose the Brain to the Air; But I helpt him to clear his throat, where was remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the root of his tongue: he seemed to approve of my Endeavours, and implored my Art by the signs he made with his hands. I askt him if he would drink, and proposed a sign by the holding up a finger, which he presently held up and immediately both his hands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his thirst, a Soldier fetcht some milk, &amp; brought a little wooden dish to pour some of it down his throat, but part of it run down on both sides; he made signs to have the dish in both his hands, they gave it him full of milk, he held the root of his tongue down with the one hand, and with the other poured it down his throat, (carrying his head backward) better than I had done, and so pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down more than a quart; After that I bound his wounds up, the dead were removed from thence to their graves, and fresh straw fetcht for him to lie upon, with an old Blanket to cover him, it was in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; there we left that deplorable Creature to lodge, and while we continued there which was about 6 or 7 dayes, all that while he was drest by some of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41836:77"/>with a fomentation made with our Vulnerary decoctions, with a little Brandy-wine in it, then with <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes</hi> dipt in our common Suppurative we bound him up.</p>
                        <p>I could tell you of many wounded into the Brain, but do think these may serve to prove what I would declare of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Brain is of it self insensible, that those Symptomes which accompany these wounds proceed from the pain which the <hi>Meninges, Dura</hi> and <hi>Pia Mater</hi> suffer: which if oppressed by extravasated bloud, or a depression of the Skull, do quickly suffer the greatest Symptomes, as Vomiting, <hi>Stupor, Paralysis,</hi> &amp;c. much more if they be pricked by any spill of a Bone, or other Extraneous sharp body. When the Brain it self ouzeth out between them in the manner already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is a mild soft substance and lenient to them, so that the accidents appear not till that begins to corrupt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and with it the Membranes themselves pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie, upon which their follows Convulsions, Howlings, and a suddain dispatch of the Patient. From which very Observation, may be seen the folly of dressing these wounds with powerful desiccatives, which so far as I could observe, did hurt the Membranes, but never either digest or Incarn the Brain. According to <hi>Hip. non Coalescet,</hi> but as it gets liberty, works it self forth like unto Barme, and as I have said corrupts, and the <hi>Meninges</hi> suffering from that putrefaction, <hi>Spasmus</hi> follows, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient dies; At Sea these Patients wounded in the Brain died presently, we having no conveniency of lodging them, or dressing them so warm as they require. In the wars my Imployment did not permit me to see the finishing of their Cures, and here in my Practice in and about the City, I never was called unto any such wounds, therefore must leave that to others to treat off: But by what I have seen from them heretofore, their Cure consists in dressing them, as in wounds of the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> and in keeping the Brain within its membranes, without which no Incarnation can be made on the Membranes.</p>

                     <p>GReat hath been the Contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Learned about fire and venome in Gun-shot-wounds;<note place="margin">Gun-shot wounds, whether fiery or venom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> some maintaining the one, some the other to be in them; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers defending, that there is neither. That which I suppose might be the occasion of their suspecting <hi>Empyreuma,</hi> and a <hi>Venefick</hi> quality, was the deadly colour of these Wounds; which in those early dayes, when the Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Guns was novel, surprized them; they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41836:78"/>being not unlike poysoned and burnt Wounds. Where the Bullet pierceth, it extinguisheth the natural heat, and the lips of the Wound are livid, or blackish, and if not drest rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, it inflames round about, from the afflux of humours, and hath <hi>ulcuscula,</hi> with a foetid smell.</p>
                     <p>In this condition the Wound is the first day, and so to the seventh, and (if not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured) it Gangreens, and so the Patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dyes. If in those dayes the Learned thus deceived by their aspect, drest them as venomous Wounds, it will be no marvel that they should write so of them: I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that in their way of treating them, they were directly as poysoned Wounds, difficult to digest and cure.</p>
                     <p>In these our times, although they do not call them venomous,<note place="margin">Errors in dressing Gun-shot-wounds.</note> yet it is the hardest thing in the world to disswade many of our Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions from dressing these Wounds with Tinctures of Myrrhe, and Honey of Roses, and thrusting in of great Tents, by which way of dressing, I have seen these Wounds, undigested the tenth day, one whereof was in the Cheek, with dry and flaggy lips. These lesser fleshy wounds, being undigested, at last Gangreen; and in truth it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at. I will undertake to shew you the Experiment every day; and that in a Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel or Issue, made by a Caustick.</p>
                     <p>Cut you through this livid or black <hi>Escar,</hi> and put a Pea in the middle of it, with Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Myrrhe and Honey of Roses, as I have seen some of them dress Gun-shot-wounds,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41836:78"/>and the next day, or two dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when you dress it again, it will be to your sight not unlike a Gun-shot-wound; continue your dressing it with a Pea, and with your Tincture of Myrrhe, and if it do not Gangreen, yet it will be Inflamed, and slow in digestion. And this is from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper application in the dressing it. For if you dress this <hi>Escar</hi> in the Fontanel, with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollients and Digestives, as you ought to do the <hi>Escars</hi> in Fontanels, the <hi>Escar</hi> will separate with digestion, in the worst habit of Body. And so it will in Gun-shot-wounds, with little distemper or difficulty, if you have timely extracted the extraneous Bodies. But a discontinuance in this kind of Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, makes us apt to forget our selves.</p>
                     <p>Thus at our entring into <hi>Worcester,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> when the King came out of <hi>Scotland</hi> with an Army of that vallant People, a Townsman was shot. A Pistol fired by the Cheek, shot him through his lower Jaw and Tongue, and out by the contrary Cheek, the Chirurgion of the Town a good Chirurgion, upon sight of it, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it Gangreened from the black colour; and declined the dressing it the way he rationally ought; upon which the part grows exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly painful, and inflames and Gleets with great tumefaction. After two dayes, I am called in, and by lenient Medicaments and good Bandage, keeping up the fractured Jaw, allaid the pain and digested the Wound, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in the same Chirurgeons hands, who cured it. In this person, the Wound was burnt by the flame, the very powder stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </head>
                     <p>WOunds made by Gun-shot are, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatissimum morbi Genus;</hi> The most complicate sort of Wounds that can be inflicted. For they are not onely a solution of continuity, but have joyned to that contusion, Attrition and Dilaceration in a high and vehement kind. To this we may add all sorts of Fractures and Accidents, as <hi>Hemorrhage, Inflamation, Erysipelas, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green</hi> and <hi>Sphacelus;</hi> besides the extraneous Bodies, which are violently carried into the Wound. And multiply Indications <hi>ex composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41836:79"/>affectibus, non unica elicitur Indicatio, sed plures pro diversitate morborum.</hi> The number of the Indications in compound,<note place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</note> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, must answer to the variety of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances, were it a simple Wound, the cure of it would presently be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as you have read in the preceeding Treatise of Simple Wounds) <hi>per Astringen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; exsiccantia,</hi> by such Medicaments as are of an astringent and drying quality: The cure of a Wound is the exsiccation of it; but here is alwayes joyned with these that which Indicateth the use of <hi>Emollentia, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia, &amp; suppurantia,</hi> according to that of <hi>Hippocrates, Omne quod contusum est, necesse est ut putrescat, &amp; in pus vertatur;</hi> What is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tused must necessarily putrifie, and be turned into matter.</p>
                     <p>That which is fretted and torn must also be reduced to the whole, or cut off,<note place="margin">What is torn is to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the part, or cut off.</note> before your ordinary intentions of Incarning. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in these Wounds, not onely the Bullet it self is ordinarily lodged; but many times other strange Bodies are carried along with it. For extraction of which, judicious care and industry are required in you; Here in these recent Wounds, we very rarely have a flux of blood, though the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be wounded; they commonly lie quasht in the contused flesh, until separation of the <hi>Escar,</hi> and about that time when you least think on it, they may burst out violently. I have seen it thus often break forth;<note place="margin">Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagy.</note> but if such Vessels do bleed upon the receipt of the Wound, and interrupt you in drawing out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41836:80"/>the Extraneous Bodies, you must endeavour to suppress the blood, for thereupon depends the Life of your Patient. But withall so proceed, that you may extract the Bullet first, and then be careful that in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining the bleeding, by your crowding in Dossils, and strict Bandage, you bring not on a Mortification.<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Such a <hi>Hemorrhage</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to a Souldier at the surprize of <hi>Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> by the Garrison of <hi>Portland;</hi> he was shot through the Heel; for the restraining of bleeding, I applyed my endeavours. But after all, I was put to the use of the actual Cautery, which I did successfully, and have since seen <hi>Botallus</hi> authority for it: <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius enim est</hi> (saith he) <hi>eam Ignito ferro constrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Anodynes</note> Pains are here to be appeased by <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes,</hi> but you must well consider the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, least you extinguish that small remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of heat that is left. How you shall deal with all these Inconveniencies, and not add one evil to another, I shall plainly deliver to you. And first, what must be first put in execution, which is the extracting of Bullets and other Extraneous Bodies.</p>
                     <p>The Part is at first dressing,<note place="margin">Dress pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, during the heat of Battle.</note> with what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence you can, to be cleared of all such Forraign Bodies, as have made violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion into it, while the Patient is warm with the heat of Battle, and the Wound fresh, and very little altered, by either Air or Accidents, so that less pain must necessarily follow upon the Extraction.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Armada Naval de Dunquerquo,</hi> where we Chirurgeons were oft imployed in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41836:80"/>we after every fight went together, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting one anothers wounded men: Amongst us it vvas thought a great shame if any thing of this work of Extraction vvere then to be done. For after the first and second day the Wound proveth tumefied,<note place="margin">Necessity of it.</note> all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts are inflamed and changed so in their temper, that they conceal from your sight both the Bullet and his Companions, that the place they are coucht in can hardly be known; or being discovered, you cannot without hazard of your Patient, or great trouble of the Part, make extraction of them.</p>
                     <p>And yet if the Wound be near a Joynt, or the Shot lodged amongst the <hi>Tendons,</hi> it is much to be feared the pain will not off, until those strange Bodies be drawn out; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the omission of that extraction, will bring Mortification, which hath been the cause of the death of many a brave Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And is the cause of all the mischief these Wounds are subject to, as <hi>Pain, Inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Spasmes, Convulsions, Gangreens, Sphacelus,</hi> what not? Every Battel produces Instances of it to the discredit of our Profession.</p>
                     <p>But if the Bullet be lodged in a less noble Part, as in Musculous Flesh, you may with more ease content your self, unto the seventh day, or until the fierceness of the Accidents be over, and the Wound digested. But withal, it will require more care, for the Wound will be more painful, and slow in digestion then otherwise it would be; yet by the confession of those that allow fire and poyson in it, the Bullet may ly long there,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41836:81"/>and do little harm; nay, I suppose there are not many, but have heard or seen of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets that vvithout grievance to the Patient have continued, lying long in fleshly parts of wounded men. Conceive this spoken of Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Bullets, for Iron or Brass cannot (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their aptness to rust) remain vvithout doing harm; however let nothing of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you; for the Bullet pierceth not any part, vvithout carrying raggs along vvith it, vvhich corrupts in the Wound, and makes Apostemations and prolongs the Cure, as must needs be observed by all men in their practice.</p>
                     <p>The Servant of a Noble man,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and shot in the thigh by High-way men, the Bullet not having been drawn out by his Country Chirurgeon at the first dressing, could not be drawn out by me at the second, but occasioned great pain vvith Inflamation, great heat and vvatchings: Although he had many other considerable Wounds upon him, to make a derivation; yet vvas his Gun-shot more vexatious then all the rest, until I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the Bullet and raggs carried in vvith it, yet this vvas but a Pistol Bullet. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I drew out this Bullet, my digestion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came good; and by equal Bandage, vvith gentle compression of parts, I united and healed it in ten or twelve dayes, vvhich I doubt vvould not have otherwise been cured in three moneths.</p>
                     <p>Nay, vvhile any of the raggs remain in the Wound, it vvill never cure, but the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Bodies drawn out, there is little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41836:81"/>in the curing these Simple Wounds; if drest, as I shall here following show, but if handled, as some have lately taught, they are as so many poysoned Gun-shot-wounds.</p>
                     <p>Now for the taking out of the Bullets,<note place="margin">Two me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets.</note> and other Extraneous Bodies, there are two Methods; 1. One to extract them by the vvay they vvent in; The other to open them a way, by vvhich they would, if their force had not fail'd them, have passed themselves through.</p>
                     <p>For to take them out the vvay they vvere forced in, you must place the Patient,<note place="margin">1. The way the Bullet went in. Methods of search.</note> as near as he can guess in the posture he was in when shot. And, if by reason of his weakness or other Infirmity, he cannot without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, be so scituated; let him be laid in a position which may as neerly answer it, as may be; Least some part of a Muscle, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or Ligament, obscure what you desire to make manifest. Then make search for it with your finger or probe. The Figure of these Wounds is alwayes round; the Bullet forces the Flesh in with it, and its entrance presently contracts closer; but its going out is more laxe; you may guess by view of the Wound, the largeness of the Bullet, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Figure with that, make choice of a fit Instrument for extraction, whereof you ought to be alwayes well furnished. Your main care in this work is to find out the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which if you fail of by searching into the Wound with your Probe: Then you are to feel the parts about, it being wonderful to consider how these Shots do twirle about, at least seem to do so, when the posture
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41836:82"/>is changed in which the Wound was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p>As for Example; A man hath been shot in the Cheek, and I have cut out the Bullet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the Neck: A man shot in the outside of the small of the Leggs, the whole Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unmeasurably swell'd and inflamed, no possibility of finding it out either way; at last by chance, I felt it in the inner side of the Thigh above the Knee. And so another being wounded in the outside of the Arme, I have cut out the Bullet below the <hi>Scapula;</hi> If the Bullet have not been in so long (as in some of these cases) that the parts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pained with Inflamation and Tumor, the pain where the Bullet lodges discovers it.</p>
                     <p>A common Souldier shot in the Breast through the <hi>Sternon,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> lay roaring very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously, complaining of the pain of his Back. I was fetched to him; and turning him on his side, I saw the Bullet lye like a small Wen or Scrophul, thrusting out under the Skin, not far from the Spine. I made Incision o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, according to the length of the part, and thrust out the Bullet as easily as I could desire. I dressed it, and the Souldier ceased his crying, and acknowledged before us, his pain was from the Bullet in the Skin. For indeed the Lungs and other internal parts, are seldome sensible of pain, when wounded through; they discover their hurt by other symptomes. The common Souldier dyed, as most do that are shot through the Lungs.</p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41836:82"/>
                     <p>If in your searching for the Bullet, you light on the part, though there be no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberance, or ought to be felt, yet his pain there, will be a good sign for it; if no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident occasioned that pain. Make your way there by Incision, avoiding the Vessels, and take out the Shot, and what else offers it self; by this you do both quit the part of its troublesome Lodger, and withal make way commodiously for discharge of matter, which in regard most of these Wounds are <hi>Sinuous;</hi> (the Bullet turning aside, when it is hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its journey forward) for want of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge might in those places occasion Fistu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's and hollow Ulcers, not without ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>In the work of Extraction,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> take great care you lay not hold of some Nerve or Tendon, and so pluck them along with the Bullet; for by so doing you may cause intollerable pain and grievous accidents; you must therefore neither open nor dilate your Instrument, until you may take hold of the Bullet, without any of the circumjacent parts.</p>

                     <p>AS soon as you have made a separation of these Extraneous Bodies, if you judge the Wound to be so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned, that there is neither sear of Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor Mortification, (as in recent Wounds there is not;)<note place="margin">First dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing after Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>) Be not discouraged at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever evil aspect it hath at present; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider its Livid colour to be natural in the Wounds, when the Contusion is not simple in the Skin, but through Flesh and all, as far as the Bullet hath entred, depriving parts of their sense, to the very bottom, and hath the colour of a gangreened or poysoned Wound.

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Accidents befalling Gun-shot-wounds, and of Sinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ʋlcers.</head>
                     <p>BUt from the first to the eleventh day, many Accidents are wont to happen to these Wounds, which not onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the Cure, but often, without timely help, destroy the Patient. And these are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Pain, Inflamation, Erysipelas, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deadly Accidents, as Gangreen and Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus, all which take their beginning from Inflamation. Therefore I have elsewhere par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly treated of <hi>Inflamation</hi> and <hi>Erysipelas,</hi> that you feeing what it is may in its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prevent its increase: It commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from a very ill habit of Body, or from the ill handling of these Wounds in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                     <p>The remedy is to prevent the Influx of more humours, &amp; evacuate that which is already fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the part. The first way is by bleeding largly and purging, both which are directed you in the first dayes work, if you omitted that then, you must perform it now.</p>
                     <p>The second way is by Externals; and that is by <hi>Anodynes,</hi> which may mitigate and repress
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41836:87"/>the heat of the part; as also by Discutients and Concoction of the matter in the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; which is performed by those Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were proposed in the Cure of the Wound, with observation of dyet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Prevention and Cure of these, vvith the manner of handling them, you may see more particularly in the Treatise of <hi>Phlegm</hi> and <hi>Erysipelas,</hi> how in the beginning it is to be done with <hi>Refrigerants</hi> and <hi>Repellents;</hi> and in their state by moderate <hi>Calefaction</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutients:</hi> and afterwards by <hi>Dissipants</hi> and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Discutients,</hi> to which Treatise I refer you.</p>
                     <p>The next and most cruel symptome,<note place="margin">Gangreen</note> is Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the part, which so often attends great Inflamations; and is shrewdly to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, when they yield not readily to <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutients</hi> or <hi>Suppuratives.</hi> In their Wounds it happens most commonly through a Suffocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the natural heats of the part; or through the great concourse of humours, or too refrigerating and repellent applications, in the time of great <hi>Inflamations</hi> and <hi>Erysipelas,</hi> which have infeebled and hindered the <hi>transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> of Spirits into the part. It is perceived by the change of colour, it begins to look Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, the lips grow flaggy, the tumor sinks, and it gleets and is blistered, and blew spots after a while appear.</p>
                     <p>When you see such a change begin, you must presently prepare to withstand a Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Scarification, until the blood come, not onely about the lips of the Wound, but deep into it through the <hi>Escar</hi> to the quick,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41836:87"/>and suffer it to bleed freely, and make the party sensibly feel, that by such means you may disburden it of part of what would have choaked it, and make way for the entrance of the force of the Medicine.</p>
                     <p>Then foment the part with a good <hi>Lixivium</hi> made of Ashes and Salt, with <hi>acet. vin.</hi> in which you may boyl <hi>scord. Absinth. centaur.</hi> and such like; and after Fomentation wash the scarified parts, and dress the Wound with <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptiacum, theriac. venet.</hi> dissolved in <hi>sp. vini,</hi> adding <hi>Calcin. vitriol. &amp;c.</hi> and a Cataplasm of <hi>farine, Hord. fabar. orobj. lupinor.</hi> decocted in some of the same <hi>Lixivium,</hi> adding <hi>oxginel</hi> to it, applyed over all. But for this I refer you to a particular Chapter of <hi>Gangreens</hi> and <hi>Sphacel.</hi> for further directions therein; as the <hi>Gangreen, Separates,</hi> you are to deterge; to which end use <hi>mundificat, ex Apio</hi> or <hi>Paracelsi,</hi> to which by adding <hi>praecipitat.</hi> you may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily effect your Cure.</p>
                     <p>But in the separating of contused parts,<note place="margin">Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage.</note> as I have often told you, great Fluxes of blood usually burst out upon us.<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Thus in a Patient of mine wounded by Shot, through the inside of the <hi>Radius,</hi> upon separation of the <hi>Escar,</hi> a great deal of blood broke out with impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. I stopped the Orifice which was nearest the Artery, with some mild aglutinative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; suppose <hi>Galens</hi> Powder <hi>ex thuris part.</hi> ij. <hi>Aloes p. j. cum pilis, leporinis, &amp;c.</hi> The blood then bursting out at the other Orifice, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed over that also the same Powder, and rouled up the parts with a good Compress dipt in a Styptick Decoction, laying my common
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41836:88"/>Defensative over all, and not opening it till three or four days after.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of Wounds.</note> How such Fluxes of Blood from the Arteries are to be restrained, you may see in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>Gun-shot-wounds,<note place="margin">Sinuous Ulcers.</note> the <hi>Escar</hi> being once fallen out, become Sinuous Ulcers; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after great mischievous Accidents, and vvhere Bandage cannot be used to preserve the tone of the parts, as in the upper part of the Thigh and Hipp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these Cavities causing much pain to the Patient, and difficulty and trouble to the Chirurgeon, vve shall consider their Cure. Our indication therein, is from the parts affected, the largeness of the Wound, Contusion and Laceration of parts: for contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Wounds, must of course corrupt, and turn into matter.</p>
                     <p>And if the Bullet or any Extraneous Body be yet remaining in, the parts become more lax, and are accompanied vvith pain and influx of humours, and the included Body is streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in its passage out, through generation of flesh, which causeth much difficulty in the Cure; especially if a <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> or <hi>Lues ven.</hi> be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith it, you vvill scarce cure your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, vvithout exhibiting <hi>Antivenerial</hi> and <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick</hi> remedies.</p>
                     <p>To prevent <hi>Sinuosities,</hi> you are to enlarge the Orifice at first, or keep it so wide open, that the matter that is daily there ingendred, may have free passage out, vvhich if it may not by the vvay the shot came in; then you must consider, how in another place the <hi>Sinus</hi> may discharge it self, this being pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently effected, and the matter thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41836:88"/>you shall speedily perfect your Cure, and vvith ease.</p>
                     <p>But before you make this Apertion, you must consider, vvhether by altering the Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the part, or by Compression by Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or by hollow Tents, the matter may not be brought out. And to make the Cure of these Cavities more facile, you must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to place the member in such a figure, as the Wound may be depending, and you must have Stupes, Spunges, Compresses, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive Bandage; these prest out of red Wine, vvherein is infused <hi>Flor. Ros. rubr. myrtillor. Cort. Gran. Balaust. nuc. Cypress. sumach. acacia,</hi> and dress it twice a day, and Injections of the same Decoction, vvith <hi>Myrrhae, Aloes, sarcocoll. Rad. Irid. Aristoloch. sp. vini. mel. Ros. Aq. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Aluminosa,</hi> and such like.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes in a Wound by the upper part of the <hi>Biceps diepe,</hi> the matter not being likely to discharge it self, I have by a Seton Needle preforated it through, and retaining the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted Silk, until the parts have been digested, then drawn out the Silk, and by a Tent kept that open a few daies, until the upper part by good Bandage Aglutinated. Then the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged matter below being little and good, I have left of the use of the Tent, and healed it up.</p>
                     <p>So I have often in Wounds of the Thigh, vvhere by no Position or Bandage I could o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise effect it.<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And here in the <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> in an old <hi>Sinnous</hi> Ulcer, vvhich dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it self from the right <hi>Ilion</hi> through under the <hi>Inguen, viz.</hi> by the inside of the Thigh four
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41836:89"/>fingers breadth below that place. I had great difficulty to make out whither the <hi>Sinus</hi> tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at last I found by my searching Candle, that it vvanted a little more then an Inch to pass throughout by the <hi>Glutens,</hi> and that vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any opening that vvay; the matter vvould continue to make its Cavities, upon which I applyed a Caustick there, vvhither I supposed the end of my Probe tended. Then having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out that <hi>Escar</hi> by Incision, I prest vvith my Probe against my finger which vvas vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Escar,</hi> I there felt the end of my Probe, though at a distance, upon vvhich I passed a long Canula instead of my Probe, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of that, I passed then a Needle through this Canula, and so through the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi> vvhich I take hold of, and the while pull back my Canula, and the Needle being free from incumbrance, I pull'd it forward, with a twisted Silk at the end of it, and cutting off the end of the Silk from the Needle, I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Silk as a Seton there: the Needle, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nula and Silk vvere first anointed vvith <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent. Dialihae.</hi> or <hi>Ol. lilior.</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>One shot in the Face betwixt the Nose and Eye on the right side into the <hi>Ethmoides</hi> by a Pistol Bullet,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> after some years that this Wound was cured, vvas troubled vvith a fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ichor, vvhich discharged by that Nostril, and at his first arising up in a morning out of bed, vvould discharge half a spoonful of a yellowish colour, and had made a chop or gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the lower end of this Nostrel, by its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony. After some vvhile, he could feel upon bending of his head backvvards or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41836:89"/>the Bullet to roul to and fro.</p>
                     <p>He complained to me of his grievance at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> a little before His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties going into <hi>Scotland.</hi> I proposed to him, as the onely way to free him from this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, speedily to cut through the <hi>oss. Palati.</hi> he assents to it. I placed him in a clear light, one holding his head steadily, I cut into the roof. The flesh was so close tyed as it would not yield to my <hi>Spatula,</hi> as I expected; upon which, by a quick working <hi>Escarolick</hi> held to the place upon Lint a few minutes, I consumed the soft part to the bone. Then I cut into the bone such a hole, as I, by the moving of his Head, could see the Bullet lodged in the hole, but this was not done at once sitting. Yet by degrees the Bullet was taken out, and he eased of that discharge of matter, which threatned a filthy, carious, fistulous Ulcer. My atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon His Majesty into <hi>Scotland</hi> hindred my prosecution of that Cure. I left him in the hands of a Chirurgeon there; and since have often seen him at Court: but the Ulcer did not shut up with a <hi>Callus</hi> as it might, had it been closely attended.</p>
                     <p>This way by making Incision,<note place="margin">Method of cure in Sinuous Ulcers.</note> is the speedy way of curing all these Sinuous Ulcers, if it may be safely done without wounding great Vessels, Nerves, or Tendons. Your Incision is to be made according to the length of the Fibres, and a Probe or Canula must be your guide. Having once made your Apertion, you may enlarge it as you see cause by Incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Gentian, or Spunge, to discharge the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities of the Ulcer, then digest it with the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41836:90"/>
                        <hi>Com. digestive ex Terebinth, vittell. ovi,</hi> and if there be occasion, you may add a little <hi>Mell.</hi> to it and <hi>Myrrhae Thuris rad. Irios,</hi> to make it more exiccant, but commonly the depending part oppened, the Wound is cured by Bandage, and keeping open this last Apertion a few days. If these grow Fistulous, you shall find the Cure of them in another place.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Gun-shot-wounds with Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</head>
                     <p>HAving declared unto you the way of curing Gun-shot-wounds in the soft and fleshy part; I purpose now to proceed to the curing them, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated with the fracture of the Bones; whose firmness, driness, stability and solidity cannot defend them from these Inconveniencies. Nay, in the case I am to speak of, they are rather Discomodities. For when the Bullet striketh like lightning, were they softer 'twere the better, that the Bullet might pass and not shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.</p>
                     <p>Not any of the five sorts of Fractures men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Ancients, which these blows will not occasion. Sometimes they will cleave the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41836:90"/>Bone, <hi>assulatim secundum longitudinem,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the length; and other times they will <hi>per transversum frangere,</hi> break the bones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart. Other times they will divide it <hi>ad unguem,</hi> like the Scales of a Fish. Nay, if the Bones be dryer then ordinary (as in elderly men, and in such a Nature or Diseases have made them so) they will grind the Bone like Meal. Yet I have seen, and drest a Souldier that was shot through the Joynt of the Ancle, without ever breaking the least <hi>Cartilage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The wayes to know when there is a Fracture in the Bone are many; <hi>Hipp.</hi> bids us compare the sound part with the parts affected, and observe the Inequality.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, You shall perceive a Cavity if you touch the parts above and under the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If you handle the fractured mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, you shall perceive a crashing of Bones, by reason of the mutual attrition of the hard Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There will be commonly extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pain, in regard of the divulsion of the Nerves, and distortion of the Tendinous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; or the pricking some sensible part, by the shivers of some Bone.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, There will be an Impotency of the broken Member, so that the Patient cannot lean upon it.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The antecedent cause will teach much in this case <hi>(Gunshot)</hi> then which there never was (or ever will be, I believe) inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a more powerful one.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly and lastly, The Asperity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41836:91"/>or roughness of the Bone manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to you, but the search will give you no small assurance.</p>
                     <p>In Fractures made <hi>secundum longitudinem,</hi> all Authors agree that the Member which is hurt must needs shew thicker then the other. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Prognosticks,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> you shall understand,</p>
                     <p>First, That Fractures are more easily cured in young people then in old, for the greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance there is <hi>à pueritia,</hi> the more the <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum primo-genium</hi> is exhausted. Wherefore in Youth, Bones will be again Consolidated by the first Intention, in others only by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Interveniente materia (aliena) quae non est ejusdem naturae cum osse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Bones receive a quicker Aggluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in Sanguine, then in Chollerick Bodies, by reason of the benignity of the <hi>Serum</hi> which sendeth out better matter for a <hi>Callus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Bones are broke with less danger in the middle, then near to the Joynt; they are both more hard to be restored, and to be kept so restored. And because of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Symptomes (which in such Wounds cannot but <hi>Supervene</hi>) are not without great difficulties to be cured.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Those Fractures are dangerous which are made so deep in the fleshy parts, as our hands cannot well come at them, to place them right.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, A great Fracture is of more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a small. I term that a great Fracture where the solution of continuety is large, the accidents suddain, many and terrible.</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41836:91"/>
                     <p>Sixthly, Fractures made by Gun-shot, are of far more danger then any other, in regard of their multiplicity of Complicacie.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Among all Fractures the most to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable is the <hi>Transverse,</hi> if it be oblique 'tis worse; still worse if the Bone be much shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; but worst of all if the Shivers be sharp and pungent. Amongst the Cruisers in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Frigots from <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> it was complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that their Chirurgeons were too active in Amputating those fractured Members, as in truth there are such silly Brothers, who will brag of the many they have dismembered, and think that way to ly themselves into credit: but they that truly understand Amputations and their Trade well, know how villanous a thing it is to glory in such a work.</p>
                     <p>In the Roman History you will find it was not allowed at all. <hi>Livy</hi> tells you their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward among them. But later Experience judgeth it commendable, if it be necessary, and done in its proper time, that is to say, suddenly; whereas Amputations the next day are worse then death to them.</p>
                     <p>Not so in proper time;<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for in the heat of Fight I cut of a mans Arm, and after he was laid down, the Fight growing hotter and hotter, he ran up and helpt to traverse a Gun, and a <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon,</hi> while I was cutting of his Legg, cryed; <hi>Depechae vous con nous vendrone a terre nous bivron,</hi> Haste ye, haste ye, when we come a shore we will so drink: But amongst us aboard in that Service, it were a great shame to the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, if that the Operation were to be done the next day, when symptomes were upon the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41836:92"/>Patient, and he spent vvith vvatchings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore you are to consider well the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and if you have no probable hope of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, cut it off quickly while the Souldier is heated and in mettle. But if there be hopes of Cure, proceed rationally to a right and methodical Cure of such Wounds. This fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Method is best.</p>
                     <p>Cleanse the Wound first from all strange Bodies,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> as Bullet, Armour, Apparel, Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Bones. If the Fracture be near a Joynt, the violence of the blow will many times add a Dislocation also to it. If that happen, restore the Joynt first to its place, before you meddle vvith the Fracture; these dislocations are made by great Shot, or pieces of great Wood, whose force shatters the Limbs in pieces, or carrying it quite away: but this later I never see so done, but that vvhen the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is shattered it hangs by the side, by some little part of the Musculous Flesh and Skin.</p>
                     <p>Here your vvork is vvith a good Razor or Knife presently to plain the Stump,<note place="margin">Smooth the stump.</note> and pull up the Flesh, that you may saw off the end of the Bone as even as may be.</p>
                     <p>In one of these,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> whose Arm was shot off above the Elbow, in haste we drest him up, his shoulder proved out of joynt: The next day we could not set it by reason of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of the stump, it was a greater pain then his Wound, and pained him for some months after, but it happens often and in short stumps is remediless. One of our Captains Reformadoes had been served so formerly with his stump.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41836:92"/>
                     <p>If you will endeavour the remedying it, you must do it by help of a Bandage, made above the stump, but if it be above the Elbow, how will you fasten it? yet in some Bodies they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored easily, therefore attempt it before you dress the member.</p>
                     <p>In another that had his Leg shot off in the place of Amputation below the Knee;<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> some two months after, when I wondred the Bone would not scale, I put my Forceps to feel whether any part of the Bone was loose, and feeling it very loose, I took hold of it gently, and found it willing to come away, it was the <hi>Apophisis,</hi> or head of the great Bone which makes the Knee. I was surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at it, but considering what is loose must away, I pull'd it out to the amazement of the lookers on, this was relaxt from its ligament, by the force of the blow.</p>
                     <p>In these fractured Wounds made by Gun-shot, the Chirurgeon ought to propose two things to himself, first the Fracture, and then the Wound. To proceed orderly you begin with the Fracture, <hi>viz.</hi> by Extension and Coaptation, that thereby the Fracture may be reduced to its proper seat; which in all these cases must be performed with much steadiness and discretion, not with such force as in them without a wound, lest the <hi>Musculous</hi> or <hi>Nervous</hi> parts being torn, bruised or crushed, should cause extreme Pain, Convulsions, and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification (and that which in special we seek to prevent) death may unaware ensue.</p>
                     <p>And therefore this Operation would,<note place="margin">Dislocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</note> if it possibly might, be dispatched presently after the receipt of the Wound, before Inflamation come on; but if the part be accompanied with a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41836:93"/>Flux of Humour and Inflamation, before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be brought unto you, then you must forbear the Extension until the third, seventh, or eleventh day, according to <hi>Hipp.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if it should so happen, that through such Inflamation the Operation be delayed longer; it is then to be feared, Putrefaction, and other ill Accidents will happen, and your Patient run great hazards of his life, or a continual lameness of that Member.</p>
                     <p>The Extension made moderately; fit the Bones into their former place, with what gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dexterity and lenity you can possibly. If the Wound be narrow, dilate it by Incision at the first, for these Wounds require more dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than any other, that not only the bruised and vitiated bloud and other excrements; may have a free passage; but that also by this means the shivers of Bones, of which these Wounds use to be very full, may with less trouble be discharged by nature, or extracted by your selves.</p>
                     <p>If you make not this dilatation in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">Dressing.</note> you may afterwards perhaps be forced to do it, when the part is accompanied with great defluxion and pain, and the bones alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the retention of matter, and not only to cut and open the Wound to the vexation of your Patient, but to keep it so dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Now consider whether the Bone be bare or not; which you may satisfie your self in by your Eye, or your Finger, and the slipping of your Probe. If it be, you must apply next to the Bone some dry or exsiccant Medicine,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41836:93"/>
                        <hi>sicca, siccis Gaudent,</hi> dry to dry. Of this sort are dry Lint,<note place="margin">Dressing of Gun-shot with Fractures,</note> Powders of the roots of <hi>Iris, Myrrh, Aloes, Thus, Spirit of Wine;</hi> take heed of <hi>Oyl,</hi> for it makes the Bones apt to foul, and hindereth <hi>Callus.</hi> This done, proceed to the Wound, which is alwayes with loss of substance, and commonly with lacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Flesh, what of it cannot be restored to good purpose cut away, and dress up the Wound with your <hi>Suppuratives</hi> warm, as hath been proposed in simple Gun-shot, with an Emplaister of two parts <hi>Diachalchith,</hi> and a third <hi>Paracels.</hi> with <hi>Ol. Ros.</hi> or <hi>Empl. de minio malaxt.</hi> with <hi>Ol. lumbric.</hi> over the Wound, and over the whole fractured Member, this <hi>Empl. Diachalcit.</hi> with the addition of <hi>Colophoniae, pul. Rad. consolide. Mai. Bol. Armen. cort. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator. Succo plantag. Ol. myrtill. Lumbricor. &amp; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae, qs.</hi> as a <hi>Cerote</hi> over all, or double cloaths dipt in a red Wine vvarm, wherein hath been infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Flo. rosar. Rubr. Balaust. sumach. Baccar. Myrtill. sumit. Absinthii, &amp;c. Ol. Ros. &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Intention which is required in these fractured Wounds, is Deligation;<note place="margin">Deligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> for unless they be rightly fitted, none of these Fractures, of what sort soever, can hope for perfect Unition and Cure. In Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fractures without a Wound, all kind of Bandage may be admitted,<note place="margin">Bandage to be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Gun-shot-wounds with Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</note> whereof you may see in my Lecture of those Fractures various sorts, with many circumvolutions about the Member. And once in seven dayes opening will serve your turn. But in these another method of binding is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, for here the Bandage is to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41836:94"/>loosned daily, the Wounds lookt into and drest: They being here to be long kept open, for discharge of Excrementitious and Puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter made in them, which otherwise wound corrupt the Bones.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in these like Wounds, you must use such a Bandage as may least shake the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured Member,<note place="margin">Manner of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in Gun-shot with Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</note> for these Wounds being every day to be drest, the so often rouling up the Member would cause grievous pains, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der union. Therefore it is that Authors have invented so many kinds of Bandage, to answer the intentions of dressing the Wound, and yet keep the Member immoveable. And your Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in this case, is to be made of softer and broader linnen clothes, then that we use in Simple Fractures, that it may comprehend both the Fracture and the Wounds, keeping the lips down, yet not hurt them, by its too hard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, <hi>Minus astringendae sunt fasciae quam si vulnus non adesset,</hi> saith <hi>Celsus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore we make choice of a piece of Cloath soulded three or four times double, to give them the more strength, and of such breadth to incompass the lips of the Wound and fractured parts; and of that length as to come once about the Fracture. It is to be cut into three pieces from the ends to the middle, which middle lyes undivided underneath, to bear more equally the fractured Member; and these ends to come over one another, with a Compress between, over the Wound, to press the lips of the Wound equally down, which would otherwise become crude, and put out great lips. The Compress also serves to receive
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41836:94"/>the matter, and fills up the inequality: These are so to be fastened, as that you may dress and undress the Wound without disturbing the Member.</p>
                     <p>But for that it happens, that in these Gun-shot-wounds the Bones are shrewdly shatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Wound lacerated; and by reason of the largeness, the Wound is most painful, and the part so weakned by its Fracture, as it cannot be kept steady by this Bandage: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we make use of <hi>Ferulae</hi> or <hi>Splints;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Splints.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have made mention in my Lecture of Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in General, with the Judgment of the Ancients, who have been very Industrious in contriving wayes to make equal compression, and leave a way for the dressing of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Fractures.</p>
                     <p>Their use is not to be until the Inflamation and flux of Humours be off,<note place="margin">When to be used.</note> which is not until after the seventh day; Mean while I propose <hi>Splenia,</hi> which are linnen clothes foulded four times double, and cut in length and breadth like the <hi>Ferulae,</hi> so as it may encompass the whole Fracture: these are to be spread with <hi>Galen</hi>'s <hi>Cerote,</hi> or any Oyntment, so thin as they may adhere to the part only until you have put that Bandage over it; and this is that I propose where there is pain and fear of Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>These will handsomely strengthen the part, and make such equal compression, as the Bones; may be kept in their place, the serous humours prest out of the <hi>Cavernulae,</hi> and the fractured Member lye soft, which is a great help in these Wounds; the whole welfare of the Patient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41836:95"/>upon the easie Bandage and Position of the Member. The Pain and Inflamation gone off, and the Wound digested, (or if you think the Member not so subject to Inflamation, and that it require a greater strengh to support it) you may use Pastboard cut into pieces pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to lay over those <hi>Splenia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</note> or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fastned those <hi>Splenia</hi> by the broad Bandage with three heads, cut a peice of Pastboard fit to receive the lower part of the Member, wet it to make it more pliant, cutting a place commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously to dress the Wound at. Under this Pastboard three Ligatures are to come, which, after you have placed another Pastboard above to answer that underneath, you are then to firm close by these Ligatures in the most convenient place, for the ease of the Patient: or if the <hi>Splenia</hi> be wet in whites of Eggs and applyed, they will strengthen the Member, and keep it steady, without those of Past-bord. To this purpose we also use <hi>Laminae,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Laminae</hi> or Plates.</note> Copper or Tin Plates with soft linings to receive the fractured Member, with cuts in the out-side to receive three Ligatures answerable to the first under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. These are to fasten and loose at pleasure, without disturbance to the daily dressing of the Wound. These <hi>Laminae,</hi> or what ever else you use, must have a large cut in them, for the Wound to be drest through.</p>
                     <p>But I have alwayes observed inconvenience in these Plates, that there being not so good Compression made upon the lips of the Wound through those holes, as to hinder the lips from thrusting. There arises a laxity and indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture in the Wound; and besides the matter
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41836:95"/>that so discharges; heats the parts, and in hot weather corrupts and breeds Maggots.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I make the Pastboard or <hi>Laminae</hi> over my first to incompass so much of the lower parts as may support the Fracture, and come within an Inch of the Wound. And over the Wound it self I fasten a <hi>Splenium</hi> of Cloath, folded four times double, or a <hi>Ferula</hi> of Tin, Copper or Pastboard lined, and this accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I judge, the part can bear.</p>
                     <p>The first Bandage next to my <hi>Cerote,</hi> makes an equal Compression by its three heads meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over one another; the lowermost presseth the Influx from below, and with the help of its next fellow keeps the Bones together, and presseth the matter out of the Wound; and (by the help this middle hath of the uppermost) the matter is also prest out of the upper part of the Fracture and Wound to the Orifice, which also hinders the Influx from above, strengthened by a defensative lying under it. In the dressing these Wounds, you are onely to undo the middle Binder to come to the Wound, having a special care that this Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage be neither too hard or slack, but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to the ease of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Having thus proposed to you the vvay of deligation, I shall now proceed to the last O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration performed in these Fractures of a Wound,<note place="margin">Position of the part.</note> vvhich is a commodious Position or placing of the Member; vvhich as I have told you in the Lecture of Simple Fractures, ought to have three Conditions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Soft, least the Compression offend the hurt parts, and cause Pain and Inflamation.</p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41836:96"/>
                     <p n="2">2. Equal, for if the Member be placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, it becomes distorted, and the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration succeeds ill.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Lastly, It must ly higher then the parts next the Body, especially the first three or four dayes, for if it incline downwards, the humours by their own weight, will easily flow to the part afflicted. How this Position is performed, I have set down in the Lecture of Simple Fractures, to which I refer you.</p>
                     <p>The fractured Bones of the vvounded part thus restored to their natural places, and the Wound digested, and Inflamation and other Accidents gone off; you shall now unloose the Bandages, and take of your restrictive Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, and apply the Emplaster <hi>Cattagmat.</hi> in our <hi>London Dispensatory,</hi> or of these under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written over the fractured Member, which may add strength to the part, and further the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Callus.</hi>

                     <p>A Souldier being shot by a Musket Bullet into the forepart of the Arm, near the <hi>Biceps,</hi> and out behind, the Bone fractured: I endeavoured by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension to place the fractured Bone even toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but could not; upon which I dilated the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Orifice by a large Incision, according to the rectitude of the Member, to pull out those frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bones which hindred their right Coapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and putting my finger into the Wound to that purpose, I pull'd out a ragged piece of a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, whether it was part of that which had passed through was the question; some of the By-standers thought he was shot with a brace of Bullets; but I rather think the Bullet was torn by the Bone, and that the other part was it which had made its way thorow: however by this extraction the main Bone was rightly placed, and the Shivers, with the Extraneous Bodies removed, and the matter happily discharged by this depending Orifice, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as happily cured by the common Intensions of curing these fractured Gun-shot-wounds.</p>
                     <p>Whereas if I had taken it for granted, that the Bullet was passed through, and contented my self in having endeavoured the reducing of the fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Bones, and so drest him up, it had certainly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and Gangren'd: This confirms that doctrine in setting of Bones, that if any Bone will not be placed equally amongst his fellows, you ought to cut upon him, and take him out.</p>

                     <p>IN heat of fight at Sea, amongst the many wounded men that were put down into the Hold to me;<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> one of them had his Arm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely shatter'd, it was about two fingers breadth on the out-side above the Elbow, by a great Splinter.</p>
                     <p>This mans Arm I ought to have cut off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, but a sudden cry that our ship was on fire, put me in such disorder, that I rather thought of saving my self, than dressing my Patients. I hastily clapt a dressing upon his Wound, and rouled it up, leaving his Arm in his other hand to support it, and endeavoured to get up out of the Hold, as the others did; I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving I should never dress him, or any of them more.</p>
                     <p>But our men bravely quitted themselves of the Fire-ship, by cutting the Sprizil Tackle off with their short Hatchets (which they wore during fight sticking in their Shashes) we were freed of the Fire, and by our hoisting up the top Sails got free of our Enemy.</p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:41836:97"/>
                     <p>Now I was at a loss what to do with this man, who lay not far off complaining of his Arm. I would have cut off his Arm presently with a Razor (the Bone being shattered there needed no Saw) but the man would not suffer me to dress his Arm; he cryed, <hi>it was already drest.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fight over, we got into the next Port; I caused presently the Mariners Bed to be set up (which was four pieces of Wood nailed together and corded, and a Bears skin laid upon it, this was fastned between two Guns to the Carriages:) Upon this I see him placed, he was a lean man, above thirty years of age, of a good habit of Body; it was the right Arm, which I caused to be laid outermost, that I might the better come to dress it.</p>
                     <p>I having my dressings ready, I laid them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly upon a small Pillow well stuft, and quilted in the middle. Upon this Pillow I first laid a soft double linnen cloath, then next I laid three Ligatures, then a Past-board wet in Vinegar, to make it more soft and plyant; upon that I laid a double cloath of such length and breadth, as might serve to encompass the fractured Member, this cut from each end to the middle into three Binders. Over the middle of this I placed a <hi>Splenium</hi> of cloath four double, four fingers breadth, and of such length as to give strength to the Fracture: Over this lay my Defensative, spread upon a thick Cloath of such breadth and length as to take in the whole Arm. Dressings thus laid upon the Pillow, I cut off the dressings from his fractured Arm, and placed the Pillow with these dressings
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41836:98"/>close by his side, so as I see his Arm laid as I designed upon my Restrictive, and his hand upon his Breast. Then I put my fingers into his Wound, and pull'd out a piece of a Splinter an Inch thick, or thereabouts, more or less, then Rags and Bones great and small; I left not the least shiver.</p>
                     <p>When I had so cleared the Wound of all the extraneous Bodies and loose Bones; I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to feel what a distance or void space there was between the two ends of the Bones: But I proceeded and cut off the lacerated lips, which were of no use, and drest up the ends of the Bones with a couple of Dossils dipt in <hi>sp. vin. &amp; Mel. Ros.</hi> vvarm, and the rest of the Wound I drest as vvarm vvith <hi>Axung. porcin. Mir. praecepitat.</hi> vvith some little <hi>Ol. Terebinth.</hi> mixt upon Dossils lightly within the Wound, and upon Pledgits without, and an Emplaster <hi>Diacalcit. malanc.</hi> vvith <hi>Ol. myrtil.</hi> over all the Wound.</p>
                     <p>Then I embrocated the fractured Arm vvith <hi>Ol. myrt. &amp; olivar. Immatur,</hi> and a little <hi>Acet.</hi> and brought my Emplaster Defensative, vvhich lay under the Arm, over the vvhole Arm, from the <hi>Axilla</hi> to the Elbow, and round the Arm close, only leaving a space to dress the Wound.</p>
                     <p>This gave a strength to the weak Member, and hindred the Influx from above. Just under this Emplaster there lay a <hi>Splenium,</hi> to answer that I applyed three more, one on each side, and another above, vvhich four vvere of such a size, as they lying a little off from one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, encompassed the Arm; they vvere spread lightly vvith a little <hi>Cerote, Axungiae</hi>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:41836:99"/>and <hi>Wax,</hi> to make them adhere vvhere I placed them.</p>
                     <p>Then I brought the Bandage vvhich lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Splenium,</hi> with three heads at each end, the lowermost of these took in the lower part of the Arm from the Elbow upward, vvith part of the Fracture, and was fastned on the outer part of the Arm; this prest the <hi>Sanies</hi> from below to the Wound, and hindred the lapse of matter that vvay. The middlemost was made to press the matter out of the Wound, and keep parts close for unition. The upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most served for restraining the Influx, and press that out vvhich vvas already in the part: this Bandage vvas made vvith great moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so fastned, as they might be loosened vvithout trouble to the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Then I brought the vvet Pastboard close to the sides, and cut another piece to answer it, vvhich I vvet in <hi>Acet.</hi> and by the three Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under, made them fast, but vvithout di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance to the Patient. If it could not have been so put on, I should have forbore the use of them: the Cure of these consists in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie dressing and quiet position, vvithout that you vvill not cure one of these compound Fractures; the Pastboard as it dryed, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a shape fit for preserving the Fracture in the position I left it, and that vvith a very slack Bandage.</p>
                     <p>Thus I finisht the first dressing, leaving my Patient in much case, he slept pretty vvell that night, and vvas the next day as vvell as I could expect; he vvas let blood the second day, and kept to a spare Diet, but vve allowed a little
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41836:99"/>Wine as a Cordial to all our Patients.</p>
                     <p>The third day I drest again, took off the upper paste-board, and loosened the Heads of the main Bandage, took off that Splenium which was over the Wound; raised up the emplaister from the wound, took out many dossils, found it warm and well-disposed; drest it up quick with my Suppuratives hot, and an emplaster as before, not stirring the restrictive; made now a compress more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for the wound, purposing not to remove the two outer heads of the main Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, unless it were sometime to give a little breathing to the member; but the middle I open'd as often as I thought fit to dress the wound, the other two had short <hi>Splenia</hi> to make the Bandage equal, but I was not then satisfied how this Arm would be supplied with Bone, yet my Patient was easier then any of my Patients with fractured wounds.</p>
                     <p>When it came to my turn to be visited by my Brother Chirurgeons of our Squadron, they did not dislike the wound nor my way of dressing, (for we being used to see one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Patients, had all much one way of dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing) but they laught at the excuse I made for not cutting off his Arm, and doubted I should yet be forced to do it. But I kept my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient flat on his back, and that after a while was his greatest pain, for the Wound digested and the tumor was never considerable.</p>
                     <p>After the wound digested and a separation made of the contused flesh; I then renewed the dressings, taking all off and fomented the member with vvarm vvater, to give a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41836:100"/>breathing to it, and applyed a catagmatic Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaster, and drest the Wound vvith a mundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative Parac. or such like, and bound up the Member as at first, and so continued my way of dressing as I see cause, putting into the Wound only a Dossil or Tent made upon a skewer soft and hollow to give vvay to the Wound to incarn, I scare ever using Injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by gentle compression assisting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who seldome fails in supplying the lost substance in Wounds, if we disturb her not by improper applications.</p>
                     <p>The next opening and dressing of this fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured Member was occasioned some sixteen or seventeen days after, by a troublesome Itching of the patt; which was I suppose partly from his liberty in diet, the heat of the weather, and want of perspiration: I then took off the Dressings, and bathed with Sea-water, and drest him up with Emplaster <hi>de lithargiro;</hi> the Wound was about this time well incarned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the Lips beginning to cicatrize from their edges, I dressing them with <hi>Epuloticks,</hi> as <hi>ung. Tutiae,</hi> &amp;c. yet I kept my Patient still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his back, and renewed not the whole dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing until I was necessitated, which was about the fift or sixt week.</p>
                     <p>One day coming from the Shore (vvhere those of our wounded had liberty to lodge if they desired it, and vvere drest by us there) I found this Patient vvith a heat all over his body like an <hi>Erysipilas,</hi> he was much frighted at it, he had it seemed drank Wine a little too liberally vvith his mates, (as they would most of them do if they vvere
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41836:100"/>any thing vvell) unless it rather proceeded from a generation of <hi>Callus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Erysipelas</hi> upon the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi>
                        </note> in which case it usually happens. I let him blood, and at next dressing finding his Arm pretty strong, and his Wound healed within, and in a fair vvay of cicatrizing. I raised him up, after he had laine about eight vveeks. All vvhich vvhile I believe he never stirr'd his Arm from the time I placed it, but in the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the dressing, he being the most pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent man in that respect I ever attended; and in truth vvithout that submission, he could scarce have been cured.</p>
                     <p>There vvas in this Patient a strong <hi>Callus,</hi> filling up the void place of the lost Bone at least two Inches, vvith little or no shortning of the Arm; but the Joynt of the Elbow vvas so stiff from the position it lay so long in, that he could not stretch that Joynt whilst I knew him, vvhich vvas until that Ship vvas cast away.</p>
                     <p>My memory vvill be much cryed up for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring so many particulars in a Patient, so many years since cured by me: But if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how remarkable a case it vvas, and in my Trade, there vvill be the less vvondering at the possibility of it. You may enquire what vvas done by me in the Cure of Capt. <hi>Reade,</hi> vvhere the loss of his Jaw vvas supplyed by a strong <hi>Callus,</hi> and that Cheek uniform vvith the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and vvill be long remembred by the then standers by, though not of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
                     <p>In our Sea Fights often times a Buttock, the Brawn of the Thigh, the Calf of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41836:101"/>Leg are torn off by Chain shot and Splinters; all these are contused Wounds and look black, and do too often deceive the unexperienced Chirurgeon, he taking them by their aspect to be gangreen'd, and by dressing them as <hi>Gangrena,</hi> vvith <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> hath either gangreen'd them, or drawn the other Symptomes upon them of Pain, Fever, Delirium, Convulsions and Death.</p>
                     <p>Whereas if they be considered rightly, though they look as flesh long hanged in the air, of a dry blackish colour, yet they have vvarmth, and vvill by Lenients, as is prescribed in Simple Gun-shot-wounds, digest, and as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is made they vvill deterge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn, but they are slow in digestion, and require good Fomentations and Embrocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to cherish the native heat, vvhich is much vveakned by so great a loss of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
                     <p>These require <hi>Oleum Terebinth.</hi> to be mixt vvith your digestives, but you must have a care you do not inflame and cause Pain, by adding too much of it. A spoonful to six Ounces of your Suppurative is enough in the dryest habits; your Judgment vvill best direct you, and your Patients complaint: it being unreasonable to hope that Wounds can digest, vvhile they are accompanied vvith much Pain.</p>
                     <p>In the former Sea-fights vvith the <hi>Dutch,</hi> Capt. <hi>H.</hi> had his Hand shattered, and his Fingers torn off; Mr. <hi>L.</hi> was his Chirurgeon; who entreats me, being call'd into counsel, not to think of cutting of his Hand; I told him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41836:101"/>it vvill be of small use to him, and the Shivers of the Bone vvithin hurting the Nervous parts, occasioned those convulsive twitches and pain he was subject to and often felt; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding I promised to comply with him, if he vvould follow such Methods as I vvould propose, vvhich he agrees to, but does not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form accordingly.</p>
                     <p>I came two dayes one after another, but finding nothing of it done, at the next meeting he pretends an Excuse, not to dress the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. I then discover his craft, and that he had used me onely to defend his Credit, which was questioned for the not taking off the Hand at first, as he ought to have done, of vvhich he now saith I vvas the cause, having craftily drawn me in to be of his Opinion, though conditionally only; <hi>viz.</hi> that he should have laid open the Hand, and taken out the Shivers, which if he had done, he might have cured it, as I have done some others, as appears by this Treatise. Of the truth of this Mr. <hi>H.</hi> is Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, who also was over-witted by him. The Chirurgeon of the Ship committed the first er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he ought at the first dressing, while the Wound was recent, to have pull'd out the Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Bones, or to have extirpated the hand, that being the proper time.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Gun-shot-wounds in the Joynts with Fracture.</head>
                     <p>THE Wounds of the Joynts are subject to more grievous Accidents, then those I have heretofore mentioned, therefore they require your more particular care. The Tendons and Ligaments being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted near the Joynts for the motion thereof; as also the Membrains, and consequently the parts of a most exquisite sence. The trunk of Nerves also in every great Joynt passeth through for the use of the Member that is beyond it. To which I add, that the part being exanguious, the natural Balsome of the Body is here more sparingly supplyed for the help of the Cure.</p>
                     <p>What the pains are may be judged by the Wounds in the lesser Joynts. Capt. <hi>F.</hi> in <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selbrough</hi> fight, was shot in one of his Fingers, and the next day so grievously tormented, as he walkt up and down like a mad-man, could take no rest until his wounded finger was digested, yet his pain was not so great in his Wound, as in his well fingers. The greater Wounds are attended with much more vehement Pain, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41836:102"/>Dilirium, Convulsions, Gangreen, and are commonly deadly. Therefore the shot is presently to be extracted, and dressed with such Medicaments as may defend them from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and these are to be moderately hot and dry of subtle parts and <hi>Anodyne;</hi> as <hi>Ol. Terebinth. de Castoreo scorpion. vulpin. lumbricor. ovor. &amp; pul. scord. Thyris myrrhae, Ter. leminae pul. euphorbi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in these Gun-shot-wounds the Orifices of the Wound must be kept open, that your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments may penetrate to the bottom: But if the Wound be on the inside of the Joynts, they are commonly attended with great Haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage: For prevention of which, I refer you to its proper Chapter: And in the first place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this digestive.</p>

                     <p>If the Bone be bare, you must be careful that you do not foul it by your greasie or slabby Medicaments; you must here also consider of <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> and <hi>Ʋniversal Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If Pain be violent, and yield not to <hi>Anodynes,</hi> cut off the affected Tendon, and whatsoever corrupts, least it taint the rest.</p>
                     <p>But in these great Wounds, you are at first to consider how curable they are, and endeavour to preserve the life of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, by a timely extirpation, before his Spirits be too much exhausted: Of which this following story will give you warning.</p>
                     <p>A Page of Lieutenant Gen. <hi>D. L.</hi> was shot through the Knee,<note place="margin">A shot through the Knee</note> the Bullet entring in by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41836:103"/>the lower and outer side of the <hi>Rotula,</hi> passing through the Joynt out in the hollow of the Ham, tearing the Ligaments and Nervous parts, fracturing the Joynt as it passed, and rending the <hi>Artery</hi> in going out. This Wound was mortal the very minute it was inflicted, and ought then to have been dismembred: But such Proposals will not usually be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of in the first Dressings, whilst there is hopes: Yet the Accidents in these great Joynts thus made are sudden, from the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pain. And while <hi>Fever, Delirium, &amp;c.</hi> are upon the Patient, then to make such an Amputation, most commonly hastens his death.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I proposed my first dressing by digestion upon a <hi>Pledgit,</hi> applyed warm to the Wound upon the <hi>Rotula,</hi> there being no place for a Tent; and to inlarge the Wound amongst the Tendons and Ligaments, were to adde one mischief to another. I also embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the parts about with <hi>Ol. Ros. cum Aceto,</hi> applying my Restrictive over all.</p>
                     <p>In the depending Orifice, there was a throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Arterial blood, as in an <hi>Aneurisma,</hi> the blood being choakt in by the contused flesh, it therefore was not there to be tented, for fear of making a Flux of blood, nor yet could we endeavor to stop the bleeding by Cautery, Actual or Potential, least thereby new pains should be stir'd up, that part being full of Ligaments and Tendons.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I drest that Wound with the same Digestive mixt with <hi>pul. Galeni</hi> upon a thick <hi>Plegdit,</hi> and some of the same Restrictive over that, with such Bandage as that Joynt was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41836:104"/>of, hoping this way to hinder the Influx of humour, and that by such dressings the Wound would digest, but the pain continued vehement, and yielded to no Application, nor was there any possibility of conveying any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument into it whereby I might pull out the shivers of Bone.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Penicuke</hi> formerly General Chirurgeon to the Scottish Army, was with me at the dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this Patient, but proposed no alteration of what I had done, the pains increasing, a <hi>Fever</hi> was made and attended by <hi>Dilirium</hi> and <hi>Spasme,</hi> Death followed, as commonly it doth in all such Wounds of the great Joynts. I could instance it in many, but the late case of Sir <hi>J. L.</hi> may serve for all; his Wound, as I have heard, was of the <hi>Rotula,</hi> he had many of our most ancient Chirurgeons, with the most eminent Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to help them, Persons who were well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in Chirurgery, yet they had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter success. Therefore at Sea while they are warm with heat of Fight, we dismember them, and by actual Cautery stop the Flux of blood.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Wounds of the Belly.</head>
                     <p>I Have now briefly run through the Parts not principal; and purpose to say somewhat of the principal Parts, as the Belly and Breast. And that you may more certainly know the part wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I shall give you a short Description of them; and then shew how they are to be handled in order to their Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Belly is called <hi>Abdomen,</hi> or <hi>Inferior venter,</hi> it begins from the bastard Ribs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it self to the Groins, and is divided into three regions by our Anatomists: The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, middle, and lowermost. The uppermost is called <hi>Epigastrum;</hi> the middle <hi>Regio Ʋmbili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calis;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Abdomen</hi> described.</note> the Inferior <hi>Hypogastrium:</hi> The sides of the uppermost are the <hi>Hypochondria;</hi> the right <hi>Hypochondrium</hi> possesseth all the Liver; in the left is the Spleen, between these is placed the <hi>Ventriculus</hi> or Stomach. In the middle part
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41836:105"/>of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is the Navel, round about which ly the Guts, and behind those, on each side the Kidneys. In the sides of the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or part are the <hi>Ilia,</hi> the <hi>Pecten</hi> or <hi>Pubis</hi> in the middle, under which lyes the Bladder. Thus much to the Internal Delineation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Abdomen</hi> consists moreover of parts containing and contained.</p>
                     <p>Parts containing or teguments of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> are either the common, which reach all over the Body, as the <hi>Cuticula, Cutis, Pinguedo, Membrana Carnosa,</hi> or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and proper to this place, which are the Muscles of the Belly the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> and in respect of the Guts, the <hi>Omentum.</hi> The parts contained are some of them designed for the nutrition of the whole Body: others for Expurgation; and others for Generation.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Stomack, small Intestines, Mesenteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, vena porta, Cava, Arteria magna, &amp; Celiaca, magna,</hi> the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Spleen</hi> serve for Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The <hi>Bladder, Gall,</hi> all the <hi>Intestines,</hi> but especially the great ones, <hi>Kidneys, Ʋre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> for Expurgation; and for Procreation <hi>Vasa praeparantia &amp; differentia prostatae &amp; uterus</hi> in Women. Which parts containing and contained are subject to this Gun-shot, whence various <hi>Species</hi> arise of these Wounds, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the containing parts; as <hi>Cutis, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedo, Caro musculosa</hi> onely are wounded, so as neither the <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> nor the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts suffer any hurt.</p>
                     <p>And this hapned to many in Service,<note place="margin">Wounds not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating.</note> who have been brought to me as mortally wounded; whereas I upon search have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41836:105"/>found the Impression only upon a greazy Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jerkin, or their Bellies black or a little scratcht by the Bullet: In others the skin and flesh wounded and no further, these latter are call'd Wounds of the Belly, not penetrating, and are cured as Gun-shot-wounds in fleshy parts; in which cases all those things are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, which have been delivered in simple Gun-shot-wounds.</p>
                     <p>But this I must take notice of to you, as having often observed, not onely in Gun-shot-wounds, but in abscesses of the Belly, that from the laxity of the parts, they are subject to great defluxion, especially in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent Muscles: to my late vexation, whilst I was writing a rude draught of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the matter flowed out upon us, Dr. <hi>S.</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, Mr. <hi>Gin.</hi> and my self Chir. from various <hi>Sinuses</hi> raising up the Muscles, insomuch that the more we laid them open, the less hopes we had to effect our Cure. The particular where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I shall give you in another place, with more of that kind, enough to shew you the laxness of these parts, which is the greater, because we cannot make such Bandage here as else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, by reason of their figure, scite, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion.</p>
                     <p>These thus briefly considered, we pass to the other <hi>Species,</hi> for the Bullet is for the most part carried with such force, as it not onely wounds the fleshy parts, but also pierces the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> hurting most an end the Internals.<note place="margin">Wounds penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> It being indeed impossible that the Bullet piercing the parts containing, should miss the contained which are soft and tender.</p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:41836:106"/>
                     <p>I have seen sometimes in the Wars, a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier shot scarce to the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tusion hath been so great that the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> hath come of upon digestion, and the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in these commonly labour under Cholicks, and the Patient is troubled with difficulty of breathing.</p>
                     <p>If the Bullet penetrates through though no further, yet the Contusion makes foul work and requires speedy relief. But if it hath wounded the Internal <hi>Viscera,</hi> then you are to consider what the parts are that are wounded, whither the Liver, Stomach, or which of the Intestines, which you may apprehend from the scite of the part, and the accidents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying such Wounds, and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per symptomes of each part.</p>
                     <p>According to <hi>Celsus, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 26. The Liver being hurt,<note place="margin">Signs of the Wounds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                        </note> there follows an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of a gross blood; if the <hi>Porta</hi> or <hi>Vena Cava</hi> be hurt, the right <hi>Hypochondrium</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest: If the <hi>Artery</hi> be wounded, the blood is florid, and with Impetuosity leaps forth, and death follows. But if the Stomack, Singul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus or Hiccup, with Vomiting and Nausea, and his sustenance comes out of his Wound, with the Chyle, cold Sweats, and the extream parts cold: Of the Intestines, if the lesser be wounded, poraceous Vomiting, what he eats or drinks, will pass out of his Wound in less then half an hour.</p>
                     <p>If the great Intestines be wounded, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements and filthy smell will demonstrate it: If the Wound be of the lest <hi>Hipochondrium</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the short Ribs, you may conclude the Spleen
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41836:106"/>wounded, and the blood floweth forth with great Tension of the <hi>Hypocondrium.</hi> If the Kidneys, the Wound is in the region of the Loins, near the <hi>Vertibra,</hi> under the <hi>Diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and the more certain sign is, if the pains reach to the Groins and Testicle, with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Urine mixt with blood, or pure blood voided by the bladder: If the <hi>Ʋriters</hi> be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Urine comes out of the Wound: If the Bladder be wounded, that part of the Belly is tense, pains are stirr'd up in the Groins, and the Urine is discharged by the Wound, and the Stomach suffers by consent, and the part wounded demonstrates it: If the Womb be wounded, vehement pains reaches to the Groins, and the <hi>Coxa</hi> and the Blood not only flows by the Wound, but <hi>per Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam</hi> they are troubled in mind, with other shrewd symptoms of death,</p>
                     <p>For what concerns the Presage of these Gun-shot-wounds,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> if they be only in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Belly, they are not without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, and much loss in the middle, where the <hi>Linea Alba</hi> is; but if they penetrate, (as you may know by the signs forementioned) there is great hazard, seldome parts so shattered recover. What I have here seen from a man discharging his Excrements from the Colon on the left side, and heard of other like of the Stomach, are rather Miracles, then the work of the Chirurgeons; but he was happy that had the managing that Cure.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Celsus</hi> in his time determined these Wounds mortal by cutting Weapons, how much more must they be such that are made
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41836:107"/>in our age by Gun-shot; Yet Nature, as one saith, <hi>in his Vulneribus, Saepe miracula face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re solet,</hi> is often as merciful and miraculous in the Cure, as the blow was cruel.</p>
                     <p>In order to the Cure,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> we must begin with the Extraction of the Bullet, least it sink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most inward parts, and by its hardness offend the Bowels, as also the rags carried in with it, least it beget Putrefaction. Then we are to reduce the Omentum and Intestines least they be Inflated and altered by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Air: but in these Wounds they do not often fall out, unless it be by Splinter, or great Shot. Then <hi>Hemorrhagia</hi> is to be staid, and Inflamation allay'd, and we are to resist Putrefaction, by bringing these contused and lacerated Wounds to digestion.</p>
                     <p>The Intestines and Omentum are disposed to reduction by warm discutient Fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but if there be not an opening large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, you must enlarge the Wound. If the Omentum be corrupted, make a Ligature below that corrupt part to cut it off, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ligature upon the rest to fall of by digestion.</p>
                     <p>If there be <hi>Haemorrhagia,</hi> you must inject such Medicaments as have a Refrigerant and Astringent quality, and those may be <hi>Aq. urtic. plant. spermatis Ranar.</hi> with <hi>Syr. de Ros. sicc.</hi> with <hi>pul. Bol. Armen. ter. sigil. sang. dracon. Aloes, Thure,</hi> making a mixture of some of the same Pouders, with a new laid Egg, with <hi>Ol. Mastich. &amp; Lumbricor,</hi> and apply it upon a Tent fastned to a thread,<note place="margin">Wounds of the Stomach and Guts.</note> as is before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and apply the rest upon a Stupe over all.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41836:107"/>But if there be no Flux of Blood, digest as fast as you can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fallopius</hi> hath recommended to our use this, by the use whereof he cured a Wound in the Stomach and Intestines.</p>
                     <p>℞. <hi>Fol. Pilosellae plantag. rad. Tormentillae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solid. maj. flor. hypericii,</hi> these were decocted in red Wine; in the latter end of the dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing adde a little <hi>Manna, Thuris, ol. Mastich. resin. Abiet. Terebinth. Cypriae, croci &amp; verm. terrest.</hi> the Wound within to be drest with this.</p>
                     <p>If there be Putrefaction, you may use such Medicaments as are fit in that case, but those dye in great pain: In all these Wounds of the Belly, to stop fluxes of Blood, I use such like Medicaments as I have proposed, and apply to the Wound it self Digestives, as in simple Gunshot, and by good Fomentations, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brocations and Cataplasma's, cherish the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive warmth of parts.</p>
                     <p>In Wounds of the Kidneys,<note place="margin">Wounds of the Kidneys.</note> you are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject such Medicaments as have an Abstersive and drying quality as <hi>Radices, consolidae, Iri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, Aristoloch. rot.</hi> and <hi>maj. myrtil. caudae equin. plantag. Balaust</hi> these decocted in <hi>aq. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat.</hi> adding after some Wine, and <hi>Mel. Ros. digestivum Terebinth. &amp; Integ. ovum</hi> with a little <hi>Terra sigil.

Hordei. fabar. &amp; orobi</hi> deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in <hi>Oxymell.</hi> adding a new laid Egg to it, with <hi>Ol. Ros.</hi> to be applyed over all.</p>
                     <p>If the Liver or Spleen be wounded,<note place="margin">Wounds of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Spleen, &amp;c.</note> there will be great Flux of Blood, in which case I offer this to you.</p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:41836:108"/>
                     <p>℞. <hi>Plantag. pentaphyl. polygoni Mille-follii, myrtil. Ros. rub.</hi> to these you may adde <hi>Thuris, sang. dracon. Bol. Armen.

                     <p>Thus you are to dress all the Wounds in particular parts of the Belly.</p>
                     <p>The Wounds of the Womb are accounted deadly, the very least of them: and so are all these made by Gun-shot, yet you are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the universal regiment with Glysters and Bleeding, and by good Vulneraries: there Diet here is to be medicated, and all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to dispose parts to sanity, if it were possible.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Gun-shot-wounds of the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax.</head>
                     <p>AMongst the principal parts which are subject to this divelish Invention <hi>Gunshot,</hi> the middle <hi>Venter</hi> or <hi>Thorax</hi> is numbred with the parts contained in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Heart, Lungs,</hi> great <hi>Artery</hi> and <hi>Vessels,</hi> with the <hi>Mediastinum.</hi> The difference of these Wounds is as in those of the Inferior <hi>Venter;</hi> sometimes it doth not penetrate into the <hi>Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> so as the <hi>plura</hi> is not hurt: Other times it doth penetrate through the <hi>Membranae</hi> and <hi>Costae,</hi> in which case the principal <hi>Viscera</hi> are wounded or not wounded.</p>
                     <p>If the Wound do not penetrate into the <hi>Cavity</hi> of the Breast,<note place="margin">Not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating.</note> but be only in the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous flesh, it shall be cured as Wounds in the fleshy parts.</p>
                     <p>But if the Bullet hath penetrated into the <hi>Cavity,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> it may be easily discerned by the Laceration of the musculous flesh, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by the Fracture or Perforation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ribs,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> whereby the Wound is left open, and the Spirits and Air pass out vvith noise; and if the contained parts be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41836:109"/>there vvill follow a Flux of blood by the Wound or Mouth, or by both, unless the blood fall down upon the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and then the Symptomes of the difficulty of breathing and such like Accidents, vvill more demonstrate its Penetration. And if the Lungs be wounded, a Cough, with difficulty of breathing, and flux of blood, and sighing often, and a ratling in the <hi>Aspera Arteria,</hi> the Patient inclining to ly much upon the Wound. If the Heart be hurt, the blood flows vvith impetuosity and reeking hot, their Pulse languishes, cold sweats follow, and they dye.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Diaphragma</hi> hurt, draws upwards, the Spine is grieved, very difficult breathing, and unequal and painful, vvith a hoarse Cough, and great pains about the false Ribs.</p>
                     <p>If the great Vein or Artery be hurt, a terrible Flux of blood follows; if it flow from the right side, it is the <hi>Cava</hi> is hurt; but if from the left side, we suppose it the Artery, you vvill discover it by its saltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and florid colour. The <hi>Aorta</hi> wounded, that Patient dies at the instant.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Spinalis medulla</hi> be vvounded, the Nerves are resolved, and a Palsey follows, more immediately in the part under the Wound. Almost all these Wounds are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, they generally dye. But it is not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vvith Religion or Humanity, to leave them without help. And for that I have happily prolonged the life of some, and have known others that have recovered of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41836:109"/>some of these wounds, in the Lungs and less noble parts thereabouts. I shall therefore proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you what concerns their Cure,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> both as to the Internal concerning the wound it self, and to that which relates to the Contusion and Inflamation Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, to prevent flux of humors, and facilitate the discharge of Bloud and Matter contained in the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> You are in the first place to draw out the Bullets and Extraneous bodies, amongst which sometimes a part of the Ribs are carried in: All these are to be removed, and the place cleared of shivers, lest they prick the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, and thereby hasten ill accidents which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend these wounds. You are then to dress the wound with a Tent dipt in this or such like, ℞. <hi>Bol. Armen. Corn. Cerv. ust. Ol. Ros. &amp; Sambuci, Farinae, Volatilis,</hi> and with <hi>ovo Integ. Misce;</hi> spread a compress with some of the same, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it over the wound: If the bloud stop not by this dressing, then it may be proper for you to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject some astringent decoction, which is otherwise than was advised in wounds made by puncture: For in Gun-shot-wounds the orifice is wide enough for the Injection to return out again; insomuch that not only the Astrictive intentions ought to be pursued, but also the Detersive; here being loss of substance and putrifaction. Therefore boil in <hi>Aq. Ger. querc. Fol. Plantag. Ʋlmi, Ʋrticae, Vincae, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincae, Ros. Rubr. fol. Myrtil. &amp; Balaust.</hi> adding a little <hi>Bol. Armen. &amp; Mastich. Syr. de Symphyto qs.</hi> and if more astringent be required, boil it <hi>in Aq. Fabr.</hi> Having thus quieted the bleeding, you are to dress with this digestive, ℞. <hi>Terebinth. Lot. in decoct. Hordei</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>Pul. Thuris, Myrrhae, an.</hi> ℈ ij. <hi>Sem. Faenug. p.</hi> ʒ j. <hi>Ol. Hyperic. qs.</hi> dress with a Tent
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41836:110"/>dipt in this, then apply over it a Pledgit, with some of the same, or with some of your Suppuratives, as in simple Gun-shot-wounds is prescribed, and Embrocate the breast and parts about with <hi>Ol. Amygdul. &amp; Lumbric.</hi> with <hi>Ʋng. Dialth. m.</hi> and an <hi>Empl. Diach. simpl. cum. ol. Lumbric. dissol.</hi> and after digestion you are to Inject such medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments as have power to deterge, and are more resolvent, whereby the Matter is disposed to be discharged by the wound; and to this purpose <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. Scordii</hi> dissolved in Wine, with the addition of <hi>Mel. Ros.</hi> is proper, or <hi>decoct. Pilosellae, Caude Equinae, Plantag. Tormentillae, Consolidae, Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch. Rot. Rad. Iridis, &amp; Sarcocollae,</hi> these boil'd in <hi>Aq. Font.</hi> adding Wine to it, with <hi>Mel. Ros. qs.</hi> and then you may dress the wound with this <hi>Mund.</hi> ℞. <hi>Terebinth.</hi> ℥ ij. <hi>Farin. Hord. Cribrat.</hi> ʒ j. <hi>Thuris, Sarcocol. Rad. Iridis, an.</hi> ʒ iij. <hi>Mellis Ros.</hi> ℥ iiij. <hi>Misce S. A.</hi> You may dip your <hi>Canula</hi> or Tent in this, and dress the wound in the fleshy parts with the same. The wound deterg'd incarn and cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize, as is said in other wounds, but keep a <hi>Canula</hi> in it, until it cease to run. <hi>Celsus</hi> proposes, that in all these Internal wounds the outer parts be vesicated, to draw off humors more powerfully from within, and the medicament he proposes thereto is, <hi>Sal bene contritus cum cerato mixtus, quia leviter cutim ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, eoque impetum materiae quo pulmo vexatur evocat.</hi> This his proposal may be proper in wounds made by sharp weapons, as by Arrows, &amp;c. But here in these wounds there is vexation enough outwardly to make a revulsion, if that signified any thing. In the dressing these wounds you must be careful to cut off the sloughs without, lest from them a stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gleet distil upon the <hi>Viscera</hi> within: And in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41836:110"/>order to the cure there is required <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Patient lost bloud by his wound: Here are also Clysters required to keep the body open, and the more temperate: Pectoral decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are here proper; such as is in the <hi>London</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensatory, omitting the hotter Plants; to them may be added <hi>Syr. violar. de cichor. de liqueritia, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jub. Capil. Ven. de symphyto, &amp; Lohochs,</hi> and such as may take off the harshness which the <hi>Aspera Arteria,</hi> and <hi>Bronchia</hi> are subject to. Their diet is to be slender, and medicated. <hi>Hydromel</hi> is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per drink in all these wounds, and may be medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with agglutinatives and pectorals added to it, and after Fever and such like accidents are dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, Asses and Goats milk is necessary, yea a diet of Cows milk alone, or mixt with distill'd milks, and sweetned with conserve of Roses; but this will be a work for the Physician a-shore.</p>
                     <p>From the defeat of the Scotch-army near <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> there came many of the wounded to St. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stons,</hi> and amongst them there was several wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Breast; they who were so shot as to have the Ribs broken, were in extream pain from the shivers, whereas those whose Bones were not hurt had scarce any pain at all, but what proceeded from difficulty of breathing and coughing: A stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sanies</hi> issuing out both before and after the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the sloughs in great quantity; in one a very great proportion daily, of a brown thin Matter, of a rank smell; none but this died under my hands; they after some while retiring to their homes, where (as I have often heard them say) their Leeches performed great Cures, by vertue of their Plants which they gave Internally, and with Fats they made Balsams of; yet I believe most of these died Tabid.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of Symptomes of Gun-shot, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Fourth Chapter.</head>
                     <p>THe Symptomes attending Gun-shot, as you have read already elsewhere, are <hi>Pain, Fever, Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Syncope, Phlegmon, Erisipilas, Gangrene, Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> &amp; <hi>Palsie.</hi> The Pain proceeds from Inflamation or Phlegmon or Erisipilas, which I have elsewhere pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely treated off, as also of Gangrene; The Fever is Symptomatical, so is the <hi>Delirium,</hi> &amp; will go off with the Pain, but may with the forementioned be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by bleeding and Lenient purgatives, such as I have mentioned, and to fortifie the Spirits against faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which proceeds from putrid Vapours and Pain which may affect the part, there are Cordials and <hi>Epithemata</hi> already taught, so that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only <hi>Convulsion</hi> and <hi>Palsie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Convulsion</hi> is an involuntary contraction of the Nerves to their Original,<note place="margin">Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> by which contraction the Member is also drawn up, and is said to be caused of Repletion and Inanition; In this our case it ariseth from putrid Vapours or Acrid matter offending the Nerves, which is often found in these wounds; The part affected is the Brain, which being thus provoked causeth an involuntary contraction and rigidity of the Members. In parts dismembred, as near the Knee or Shoulder, there the Contraction cannot be discerned but by a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41836:111"/>which trembling is usually attended by a <hi>Convulsion</hi> of the Jaws: It likewise follows great Inflamations, especially in the Nervous parts; The Prognostick here is always Fatal, they being the forerunners of death.<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> In the Wars I was called to see a poor Souldier who had his Arm shot off, near the Shoulder, his Chirurgeon drest him with <hi>Egyptiac.</hi> as for a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> from which sharp dressings great Pain followed, with shivering of the Stump, Inflamations and Gleets, but no change of Colour in the skin, he had roared some days, through the vehement pain; I drest him up with <hi>Anodynes,</hi> as Linement <hi>Arcei cum vitel. ovi,</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the part with <hi>fol. malvar. violar. caps. barbat.</hi> decocted <hi>in lacte,</hi> and with Lenients Embrocated, as with <hi>ol. Lumbricor. &amp; exped. Bovinis,</hi> and applyed Empl. <hi>Diapalma cum succis</hi> over all, and anointed parts about, as Neck and Spine with <hi>ung. Nervin.</hi> and blistered the Legs and Thighs, but it was too late; he died howling.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paralysis</hi> or <hi>resolutio Nervorum</hi> is generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined a privation of Sence or motion or both,<note place="margin">Palsie.</note> in some part or parts, and affects the Brain <hi>&amp; spinalis medulla;</hi> But in <hi>Palsies</hi> which arise from wounds, the parts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affected are the Nerves of that part only, this doth not take away the life of the Patient, though it may sometimes threaten a Mortification through the resolution of the part. In a Sea-fight an <hi>Irish</hi> Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner having discharged his Gun which was hony-combed,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and loaded it suddainly again, whilst he was ramming in a Carthage, the powder took fire, and shot the Rammer out of his hand, it did tear the Palm of his hand, and some of his Thumb and Fingers: The wound was not considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but it extinguished both Sence and Motion of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41836:112"/>the Member. I drest him up with our common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestive, of which at such a time we had great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity ready, and over all a common Restrictive, so rouled him up, there being then no time for bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But after the fight I let him bloud, and the next day or two Purg'd him, and Fomented and Embrocated him, with <hi>ol. Lumbricor. Cham. Aneth. lilior. ung. Nervinum,</hi> and such like I suppose, and did all that we Chirurgeons of the Squadron thought fitting, but without success; one night lying a-sleep in his Hamock, he was awakened by the wet he felt, and got up to a Candle, and found the dressing upon his hand all bloudy, as also his belly whereon it lay: I was called, taking off his dressings, found the palm of his hand and fingers gnawed by Ratts, they had eaten through his oyl'd clothes, and had knaw'd his hand more if he had not wakened from the trickling of his bloud. I drest his wound with my digestive, purposing not to hasten its cure. I supposing it might be a help to his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. I after the cure of this made him a Fonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell in that Arm, and bathed the Member, Cupt and Scarified it, and afterwards used Emplasters of Pitch, to stir up a heat in the part; but he was a young man and otherwise of a strong Constitution, and out of hopes of reward for his lost Arm, he hastened away to <hi>Madrid,</hi> and at his return had more use of it: These <hi>Paralyses</hi> do often happen in great Contusions, and after dislocations in the Shoulders, I could instance it in several. Dr. <hi>T. C.</hi> and Dr. <hi>T. W.</hi> did both see it in a Lady who had dislocated her Shoulder. I was sent for, and by the help of her Servants set it presently, and she so well the next morning, as Sir <hi>W. G.</hi> then present scarce believed it had been out; I was dismist, but within a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41836:112"/>month after she was so Lame, as it was doubted, whether the Bone was Set or not. A Bone Setter was sent for, who at a time in another person pretended he had set so many Bones, where none were dislocated or broken. This man, I being present, acknowledged that the Bone was well Set; but had I been absent, he would have delivered otherwise, and by new Extension have rendred the part Incurable.</p>

                  <head>To the Reader.</head>
                  <p>HAving thus finished the Discourse of Wounds, I considered with my self that my design was to help the Sea-Chirurgeons, who seldom trouble their Cabins with many Books. I therefore thought it convenient to make this little Treatise as comprehensive for their use as I could, by making it contain all those things which may easily be foreseen to be of use to them. Now besides Wounds, we know by our experience that Burnings by Gun-powder and other materials do too frequently happen at Sea: and also by Ill dressing of Wounds <hi>Gangrenes</hi> and <hi>Fistulae</hi> arise, and withal much the sooner, if broken Bones, especially those with Wounds, be not well brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and so held: The ease and life of the Patient consisting in the well handling and ordering of them. All which matter we oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally handled in the foregoing work,
<pb facs="tcp:41836:115"/>yet not so much, but that for their fuller In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction I thought it requisite to anticipate something of other Discourses, I intend for the Press, by the following Appendix, which if well perused may perfect the Chirurgeon in what remains to be known concerning Wounds, and save him the labour of reading many Authors.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>De Ambustis,</hi> or Burning.</head>
                     <p>FOrasmuch as it often happens, that in close fights at Sea men are sometimes burnt by Gun-powder by their Enemies, and by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious accidents amongst themselves: I shall therefore deliver to you the most plain way of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them. For however people cry 'tis nothing to cure a Burn, yet by what I have seen of these Cures from Country or City, they are often very
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41836:116"/>ill performed. Whether they are Burnt by Gun-powder, or any other way, their Cure is much alike; they only differing, <hi>secundùm magis &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> only if they be burnt with Gun-powder, they must pick out the powder first, else they will carry the same blew mark in their faces, which some of our people use to do in their hands and arms, which I have often been employed to take out, when done wantonly in their youth; but could never remove this mark, otherwise than by taking off the skin.</p>
                     <p>If the Burn be superficial, it raises the <hi>Cuticula</hi> up in Blisters. If it go deeper into the skin, it causes an <hi>Eschar:</hi> If it burn deeper into the flesh, the force of the fire makes a hard crust with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: In all these the pain is excessive. Once dressing a Gangrened Leg with warm Spirits of <hi>Terebinth.</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Arris</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hollyer</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons, and others being close about me, and I upon my knees; the candle being too near the hot Spirits, catcht the flame, burnt my thumb and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, with that part of my hand before I could get free from those behind me to throw it into the chimny, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> was some distance off. I felt much more pain for the while in the superficial scalding, than where it was burnt to an <hi>Eschar.</hi> The pain is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; makes great fluxion.<note place="margin">Cure of a Burn.</note> The Indications of Cure are of two kinds, either by refrigerants and Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients to bath or anoint the part, until the heat be off, and the <hi>Eschar</hi> removed, and then to deterge and cicatrize; or by hot medicaments to relax the skin and open, to resolve and dissipate; and so by accident allay the heat and burning.<note place="margin">By Refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerants.</note> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerants are <hi>Aq. Solani, Plantag. Hyosciami, lac Ebutyratum,</hi> and all the cooling Juices and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents; as <hi>Album. Nutritum, Populeon. Rosat. &amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:41836:116"/>These must be used warm, until the heat and pain cease, or the fire be taken out, (as the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is) else they will rather cause pain. The other is by Rarefaction to ally the fiery heat and pain, which in the first place is done,<note place="margin">By Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</note> by the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a burning-hot Iron or fire to the part; so whilest the fire calls forth that fire it made, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes its <hi>Alexiterium.</hi> But the common remedy is to apply salt and an Onyon beaten together upon the Burn. But this is not to be done after the Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters be out; for so you exasperate the pain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the inflammation. There are many other things do the like, <hi>Fimus Equinus</hi> doth the like fried <hi>in Ol. Nucum, uvae immaturae, Sambucus &amp; Ebulus, in oleo Coct. Calx viva extinct. &amp; cum Ʋng. Rosaceo mixta, ad consist. Ʋng.</hi> These are to be renewed often, until the pain and heat be off, which they in few days effect; if there be <hi>Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> it is another kind of work: If these applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not prevent the arising of <hi>Pustulae,</hi> you must cut them as they arise, lest by their Erosion they make hollow Ulcers, and inflame with sharp pains, Fever, &amp;c. But where they are burnt to a crust or <hi>Eschar,</hi> you must hasten its fall with Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients; deterge, then incarn and cicatrize.</p>
                     <p>Here is required bleeding and evacuation by lenients and spare diet,<note place="margin">Regiment in Burns.</note> with all other regulation proportionable, as the Burn is greater or less. I could present you many cases of this, but shall give you one for all.</p>
                     <p>A Scholar of about ten years of age,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> at a School a few miles off, the evening before the Fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> having fill'd his right pocket full of Squibs and Crackers, would before he went to bed, throw
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41836:117"/>one of them in the Embers, it took fire: Whether it scattered the fire, or some spark, or that it was the Cracker, but those in his pocket took fire also, and his cloaths were on fire; his little chamber-fellow ran for help, a little boy from some other Apartment takes the alarum, first comes in, sees his School-fellow in fire, catches up a bason of water, throws it upon him, runs out, cries help, they come in and help him out of his burnt cloaths: A neighbour-Chirurgeon is sent for, who dresses him, and the next day the burnt child is brought to Town, and lodged by me. I find him burnt into the flesh, from a hands-breadth below the <hi>Axilla,</hi> down the side, and part of the belly, within two inches of the knee; in breadth from the belly, over the <hi>Os Ileon</hi> to the <hi>Gluteus,</hi> and scorcht about the edges; and by endeavouring to free his pockets of the Crackers, which was burning there, he burnt his hands from the fingers end, all the in-side of his arm to his elbow joynt; where the parts were burnt to a crust, these I anointed with <hi>Mel cum Succo Caepar. &amp; Pul. Iridis</hi> mixt; and all the parts about I fomented with a decoction of <hi>Hyosciam. Malvar. Solan. Violar. &amp; Sem. Cydon. &amp; Psillii,</hi> adding to it a third part of <hi>lac Ebutyratum;</hi> and then Embrocate the parts with <hi>Ʋng. Stramon.</hi> Then he should have been let bloud, but would not: Clysters were admitted, and pearl Juleps, his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was very great with the pains; as any Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters arose we snipt them. As they became raw, I finding that Cerots or ought else of Pledgits were apt to shut in Matter, and bring off the skin with it; dipt a fine Lawn in the decoction, and laid it over the parts, and with a feather dipt in <hi>Ʋng. de Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> mixt with <hi>Ol. Amygdul.</hi> anointed the Lawns,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41836:117"/>through which the Matter passed, and the parts lightly burnt healed; The parts deeper burnt, as they threw off their <hi>Eschars,</hi> I digested, with the yolk of an Egg, a little <hi>Tereb. lot. in aq. Solani,</hi> adding a little <hi>Farina Hordei</hi> finely searsed <hi>cum. Ol. Amygdalar.</hi> with a little Saffron. Upon the sides I laid of this <hi>Ʋng. Stramonii,</hi> with a little <hi>Calx Lot.</hi> and on other parts <hi>Ʋng. Album,</hi> adding a new-laid Egg to it. Thus each part is to be considered, and especial care that Matter be no where pent in.</p>
                     <p>In these large Burnings there are variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions at the same time: Some require anodynes,<note place="margin">Several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications in a large Burn.</note> Others detergents; digestion some, and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siccants: Some the parts drest twice a-day, Others but once: Some I drest with this <hi>Ʋng.</hi> ℞ <hi>Ol. Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buci.</hi> lb <hi>j. Cerae</hi> ℥ iij. These I melt, then taking it off the fire, I add <hi>Lithargar. Cerussae, Calcis lot. Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; Sarcocol.</hi> Upon some of these Lawns I laid Pledgits dip'd in a solution of <hi>Troch. Alb. Rhaz.</hi> made in a <hi>decoct.</hi> of <hi>Equiset. Ros. Rubr.</hi> and <hi>Summit. Rubi</hi> to cicatrize the part: And as the part bears, I make it more drying. Thus I happily cicatrized this young Gentleman, even and smooth, without the least unequal <hi>Cicatrix;</hi> nothing but the red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to make it discernable; and that was gone off his hand when I see him last: And I must tell you, in these great Ulcers it will require your care, that an <hi>Hypersarcosis</hi> be kept from growing upon you; for so your Cicatrizes will be deformed. I have had some persons of good quality come to me, so deformed with these, as they have suspected them to be wenny; and where they have hapned upon womens Breasts, they have suspected them Cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: These were much to the credit of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male-Chirurgery. In others from ill Chirurgery
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41836:118"/>the lax flesh hath grown so high and callous, as when one of them came into my hands, he required to be burnt again in order to his Cure; but I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it easier. In the face there is a special care to be had, as also in the neck and breasts of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male sex.<note place="margin">Medicines for Eyes burned.</note> A great care must be had likewise of the Eyes, that they be drest with no greasie medicines, and that the Lids be not drest with too drying, lest they contract and make a <hi>Lippitudo;</hi> in the cure of the Eyes you have Pigeons bloud, Breast milk, <hi>Aq. Solani, Plantag. Ros. Pomor. Sem. Cydon. Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nug. Troch. Alb. Rhas. Tutiae, Lap. Calam. Thus, Sarcocol.</hi> washt or nor washt. The Ears, for want of care, I have seen adhering to the scalp, and the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers one to another; and in others close contracted, with hard <hi>Callus;</hi> one of which I cut: It was a Boy from <hi>Cheshire</hi> the Lady <hi>B.</hi> commended to me.<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I cut the <hi>cicatrix</hi> of each finger, and caused a roul to be placed under his crookt fingers, which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bars to the inward part of his wrist, which had by skrew there fastened gently, thrust forward the bar, till it had born all the fingers before it, and by a compleat extension restored them to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer liberty. The wrists and other joynts are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the same inconveniences, which are preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the knowing Artist, by the well ordering them, without which the best Medicaments signifie little.</p>

They differ only as the Mortification is more or less.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and <hi>Sphacelus</hi> are much alike, the last more intense;<note place="margin">Signs.</note> it is of a deadly Livid Colour, Fetid, the lips Flaccid, without heat or sence of Knife or Fire; if there be yet sence in it, 'tis there <hi>Gangrena;</hi> If no sence then <hi>Sphacelus.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That Brother was grosly ignorant, that told me aloud, there was no need of inlarging the wound, he could turn his finger in it, and pull out the rags, &amp;c. As I came out I met Dr.</hi> W. <hi>who askt me how the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient did; I replyed the Chirurgeon within hath given me unwittingly the certain sign of his death, which I had some two or three days before prognosticated, and advised his wound to be laid open for perspiration, and the taking out of Extraneous Bodies: The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon tells me there is no need, he hath easily put his fingers into the wound and pulled out some rags,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41836:119"/>by which I conclude the Patient will dye in few hours: The Doctor replyed, yea, without doubt, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient did die the next day.</hi> In magnis vulneribus &amp; pravis si tumores non appareant, ingens malum. <hi>This was a great wound, and not being digested, it should have been accompanied with flux of humor, and Inflammation. The lips of the wound full, and rather with a narrow contracted Orifice, but the heat was decayed, the tumor sunk, and the lips flaccid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The causes of Gangreen are various in Gun-shot wounds,<note place="margin">Causes of Gangrene.</note> it commonly happens from errour in the first applications, and not making timely extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Extraneous Bodies, and shivers of bones; which prick the nervous and fleshy parts, by which great flux of humors falls into them, which debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and choaks their natural heat; Cold hard winters, by intercepting the spirits, cause mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; hard Bandage is a caused deficiency of heat in old age; And the Scorbute is often a cause.</p>
                     <p>The Prognosticks of these are sad:<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> The <hi>Sphace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> incurable; The <hi>Gangreen</hi> is curable, if the habit of the body be good and timely succoured; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it terminates in <hi>Sphacelus,</hi> and the Patient dies miserably; whensoever you see the Inflammation will not discuss nor suppurate, or that you perceive the bottom of the wound doth not matter, but feels deeper, soft and more foul, you may suspect; but if the matter be changed to worse, you may assure your self the heat is decaying, and the outer Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes in the change of Colour and sinking of the Tumor will follow. Therefore hast to prevent it, there being great danger in delay;<note place="margin">Cure.</note> If it change
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41836:119"/>colour, and Blisters arise with certain Livid spots, and they but in the superficies of the skin, Scarifie them to the Quick, and let them bleed freely, by your Patient's sensible feeling them, and by the fresh trickling down of bloud, you may judge of the mortification: But if the <hi>Gangreen</hi> have crept deeper, or arise from the bottome of the wound, then Scarifie deeper into the fleshy parts to the Quick; and if there be any abscess deep under the muscles or lips of the wound, let it out; So shall you give a breathing to the parts: If in making your deep Scarifications, you chance to cut some Vessel, whereby a flux of bloud happens, have a care of Choaking the part with your Astringents and Dossils; for so the <hi>Gangreen</hi> will be increased: In this Case, I propose the Actual cautery, which will not only secure you from a flux of bloud, but dry up the putrefaction: Then you are to apply such things, as may remove the <hi>Escar;</hi> as honey, powder of <hi>Ireos</hi> and juice of an Onyon: And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deterge, Incarn and Cicatrize as in other wounds. If in your Scarifications you wound a Nerve or Tendon, you add to the <hi>Gangreen;</hi> So you do if you burn but in part, or apply sharp Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them newly hurt; or it may be it was at first, as I said, some Nerve opprest by hard bodies, or prickt by shivers. Consider well, and if such lie in your way, (as in Nervous parts they may) you had better cut them off, or burn them through, than Scorch them: The hurting and burning of these is often a cause that the pain and fluxion is kept up. I see it daily in my practice in Sinewy parts, and while I was a writing of this, I cut off some of them to quiet the part, which otherwise upon every touch was grievously pained
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41836:120"/>and inflamed; that so I might with more ease come at the carious bone that lay under it: But if you meet with none of these accidents, then after Scari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, consider how far the <hi>Gangrene</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and accordingly cleanse the wound, by washing out the clotted bloud, either with a Tincture of <hi>Myrrhae</hi> and <hi>Aloes;</hi> with extract <hi>Scordii</hi> or <hi>Theriac. Aristoloch.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41836:120"/>over the part afflicted, and roul'd it gently on: The first time I ever used it, was upon a contused wound, on a person of a full body, his pain was great, his wound gleeting, and the parts changed in their colour: Against the next morning I was better provided, but there was no need, his pain was mitigated, the colour of the lips was returned, and the wound dry: I suppose my precipitate with the oyl had made some little <hi>Escar,</hi> therefore let it alone to fall off of it self, and applied a fresh pledget as before, over the Dossils, and after I had a while fomented the part affected, I laid over it the remainder of the former <hi>Cataplasma:</hi> The next dayes dressing the Dossils came out with good digestion, and the wound afterward was Cured.

                     <p>But if after all our vigilancy and industry in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving remedies to resist the <hi>Gangrene,</hi> it does yet delude us, and terminate <hi>in Sphacelo,</hi> there is then no more need of taking Indication from antecedent causes or changing of Medicines, according to the variety of the Causes that introduced it: whether a Gangrene arise from an hot <hi>Intemperies</hi> or cold, moist or dry; <hi>Sphacelus</hi> is alway the same extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the native heat and destruction of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: The mortification creepeth on, and not only incompasseth the Member, but infecteth the Spirit to the very heart with its corrupt vapours, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the Vessels all along the sound parts, leaving the Member immoveable without sense or heat, rotten, black and cadaverous; wherefore there is nothing now to be thought of in this case, but Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation or cutting off, <hi>quia curatio syderationis non consistet in medio,</hi> the cure of this disease not consisting, as I said, in outward applications, but manual operation; and what success may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from expected is much to be doubted.<note place="margin">Extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                        <hi>At satius erit,</hi> with <hi>Celsus, Anceps auxilium experiri quam
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41836:121"/>nullum.</hi> It is a miserable kind of help, yet it is the determination of all Authors, that in <hi>Sphacelus, Membrum corruptum abscindendum est,</hi> In this case it becomes the Chirurgeon to acquaint the friends with this last woful kind of remedy, and withal to make his prognostick accordingly, and then provide all things in readiness: But before we undertake this last Remedy, we must consider how to proceed in the operation; In those places where Amputation cannot be made, as in the Buttock, Shoulder, Back, <hi>&amp;c. Fab. Hild.</hi> proposeth the use of potential Cauteries applyed to the mortified part, and often renewed, till the last <hi>Escar</hi> reached to the live flesh; yet he condemneth <hi>Arsnick</hi> as being venemous, and producing many dangerous Symptomes: It is true, that I my self have often used that method of Cure in <hi>Sarcomata</hi> with good success, but in a mortification there appears to me many greater Inconveniences that attend it; first from the caustick it self, as he proposeth it of Salts, it will melt in the working, and is more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to spread in the skin than penetrate deep into the flesh: This every young Chirurgeon knows in his making of Fontinels, that he cannot apply a bit so little with all his Art in defending it, but that it will have spread much farther than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed it; then the separation of such <hi>Escars</hi> is too slow to effect your purpose, and in an ill habit of body, such medicaments are apt of themselves to procure a mortification rather than Cure: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, an actual Cautery answers all Intentions; it not only consumeth the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but dryeth up the venemous humour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preventing its farther progress, and also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth warmth to the languishing parts; by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41836:122"/>vertue of which the separation is much farthered, and by working upon the Gangren'd sloughs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed more easie, as I shall shew you in my prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice elsewhere. But where Amputation it self is feisable, nay altogether necessary, as in the Limbs, there ariseth a new question; Whether it ought to be done in the sound part or in the dead: <hi>Fabr. ab Aq. Pend.</hi> adviseth the dead part within a fingers breadth of the live, (as also do many others) then with a Cautery burns up all the remaining mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Others do perform the Operation with a hot Knife, the figure of which you may see in <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus. Aq. Pend.</hi> speaks so confidently of his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in the practice of this way, that utterly to deny the thing were to give him the lie. I shall only make this objection, that the <hi>Sphacelus</hi> doth seldom affect the Member so equally round, as that an operation in the dead part is feisable; nay which is worse when once the mortification seizeth on the great Vessels, it runneth up so fast under the skin, that before any considerable part of the Member is outwardly Gangren'd, on the one side beyond the Knee or Elbow; The other side will have reached to the <hi>Inguen</hi> or <hi>Axilla.</hi> This I confess frustrates all manner of Amputating, whether in the sound or mortified part: yet generally speaking the Gangrene doth not grow so fast, but that if you make Amputation two fingers breadth more or less, within the live flesh, you may prevent it, and that far better than it is possible to be done by the other way of operating; for if you work there by actual Cautery with an hot Knife, your Knife will stick fast in the flesh till the moisture be wholly dryed up, and then you must repeat many Knives and Cauteries, in every one of which you will meet
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41836:122"/>with the same inconvenience; Yea before you can cut through with your hot Knife, it is very probable that you will near the Bone meet with some parts that are alive and sensible, especially when you come to the <hi>Periostium;</hi> for the Bone doth not usually corrupt at the same rate of swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with the other flesh, and then all your pains and trouble will be as great or greater than if you did it in the sound part. As to other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, I shall refer you to <hi>Hildanus,</hi> who hath taken pains in confuting this opinion.</p>
                     <p>The greatest motives to the Ancients for the use of this and that other way of Amputating in the Joynts, I presume was the easiness of preventing fluxes of bloud this way, which they found more difficult than the other.</p>
                     <p>But modern Chirurgeons have answered this objection by good Bandages and deligation of the Vessels, and when we cut above the Knee by clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Cauteries to the Vessels only, which sufficiently answers that Intention: Thus have I seen in my first Sea voyages, Amputations made above Knee, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards practised them with great ease and safety:</p>
                     <p>Now since not only in this Chapter of Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, but frequently in this Book, we have mentioned Amputation, I think it necessary to take this occasion of shewing the manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it, the rather because the operation is much the same, whether it be done upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Gangrene, or for other reasons. I shall therefore in general terms insert the whole doctrine of Amputation though briefly, not mattering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the examples instanced be <hi>Sphacell</hi> or not; all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41836:123"/>instances being alike instructive, <hi>viz.</hi> If in heat of fight at Sea, a Leg or Arm be shattered by Splinter or Great Shot,<note place="margin">What is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in heat of Fight.</note> you are to consider the loss of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whether the principal Muscles and Vessels are torn off; or if the wound was inflicted by Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-shot in the bending of the Arm, in the inside of the Elbow, or in any of the Joints of the Leg or Arm; if you cannot extract it, or if the Bullet did pass through, yet if the fracture be great, or the shivers of Bones so lodg'd within the Joint, as you cannot pull them out, and if the Artery be wounded by the same shot, and that you cannot come to dress or stop it otherwise than by crowding dossils into the wound; you shall then presently make extirpation of them, cutting the Arm in the place where it is so shattered, and saw off the end of the Bone even; your assistant the while pulling up the musculous skin and flesh. If it were the Ankle thus maimed, you shall then cut off the Leg within three or four fingers breadth under the Knee, for that so long a stump would be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: But if it were shattered in the calf of the Leg, do not put your Patient to the pain of Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for the gaining a hands breadth or higher: If the Toes with part of the foot was shot off, cut off the lacerated parts smooth, but with care to save as much of the foot with the heel as you can; it being much better than a wooden Leg: But if the Arm or Leg be not so shattered, though the wound be large on one side, and hang gaping down with great fracture of Bones, yet be not discourag'd, the largeness of the wound will make for your better pulling out those extraneous bodies, shivers, splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, rags, or ought else; and for the easier dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of matter, dress it as a wound by a splinter.</p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:41836:123"/>
                     <p>If the great Joynt be so shot by Musquet-bullet, that you think it not reasonable to cut off the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, be sure you make extraction of the Bullet, and free it of all extraneous bodies; leaving not the least shiver to prick the Nerves or Tendons, and make such way presently, that you may be able to dress the wounded Nerves, Tendons, &amp;c. without after-openings, when the part is inflamed and unfit for it.</p>
                     <p>If after some days the wound do not digest but inflame and Gangrene, and the Gangrene do not yield to your Applications, as hath been proposed in Gangrene, then as in <hi>Sphacelus</hi> you are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with the extirpation of that rotten member, while the Patient is free from <hi>Delirium,</hi> and hath strength to bear the operation.</p>
                     <p>Seat him so as it may be for your conveniency. At Sea they sit or lye; I never took much notice, nor do I remember I had ever any body to hold them; with the help of my Mates, and some one or two that belonged to the Hold, I went on with my work. At <hi>Sterling</hi> I made an Amputation above the knee, and had as little help; besides my servants, there was only a Sea-Chirurgeons assisting me, we stopt the flux of bloud by actual Cautery, the wound digested and cured without any ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but where we have convenience to proceed more formally, there we place the Patient in a Chair, where he may be held firm, and in a clear light, and your assistance come better about you; the member is to be supported by some one of the servants, then one of your assistants should draw
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41836:124"/>up the skin and musculous flesh above the part you propose to extirpate, then make a Ligature two fingers-breadth or there-about in the sound part; so as if you Amputate in case of Gangrene, you may be sure to quit your self of the mortification. This Ligature is omitted by many of our Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons here in the City, they only making a turn with a Tape, pinning it on as a mark to circumcise by; and instead of the Ligature I. propose they make a Gripe, which Gripe is commonly made by some Assistant who is strong in Griping: Indeed this is good where a shattered member is to be cut off to smooth the stump, where there is no great fear of bleeding; but in Amputation it seems to me to be very inconvenient, for I never see any man so gripe, but that the Artery bled with a greater force than was allowable; yea when Mr. <hi>Wodall</hi> grip'd, who was so applauded, and in truth made for the work; it being so, in what a huddle is the stump then drest: But suppose the uneasie posture, and the long griping tires him, or that his hand be crampt the while, what is then the condition of the Patient? Whereas by this ancient way of Ligature which I propose, the Vessels are secured from bleeding, the member benum'd, and the flesh held steady, ready to receive the impression of your crooked Knife, (or Razor which I have often Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putated with) the Amputation made, the drawn-up skin and musculous flesh falls down to cover the stump, and the Chirurgeon hath time to take up the Artery or cauterize the mouths of the Vessels, and afterward to bring the lips over the stump by a cross stitch. This Ligature made, the Assistant strengthens it, whilest he draws up the musculous flesh; the mean time the Operator with a sharp
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41836:124"/>crooked Knife by a turn cuts round to the bone, then with the back of his knife he scrapes the <hi>Perio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium</hi> from the bone; if there be two bones, he with the Divider separates the fleshy membrane there, while the Assistant pulls up the divided parts more powerfully; during which the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor with a few motions saws off the bones or bone: If there remain any Asperity on the end of the bone, it must be smoothed. There is to be a boul with Bran or sifted Ashes to be under the member, while this work is doing, to receive the bloud: When you make this circumcision, begin in the upper part on the out-side of the Leg or Arm, cut down close to the bone, bringing your Knife round to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, where the great Vessels are; so shall you have the less effusion of bloud: That done, and the bones freed of the <hi>Periostium, Guido</hi> proposes a linning, and <hi>Hildanus</hi> a kind of a purse to be brought over the upper-divided flesh, to pull it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to make more way for the Saw; but I think that needless. The flesh divided, the parts sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enough of themselves, besides the Assistants pulling up the musculous flesh and skin is sufficient, the bone is to be sawed off close by the flesh above: that done, you are at liberty, whether you will cauterize the Vessels by a Button-Cautery, or by Ligature stop the bleeding, or by agglutination. The use of <hi>Calcanthum</hi> I do not approve, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Escaroticks</hi> to the ends of the Nerves and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, new incised, causes great pain, weakens the part, and makes way for Gangrene: It not being likely you can so apply them to the Artery, but that you must burn the parts about, which are, as I said, the Nerves, &amp;c. The way <hi>Hildanus</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by drawing the Vessels out by a pair of <hi>Forceps,</hi>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:41836:125"/>is not a work to be done in heat of fight, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a clear day-light; if you attempt it on Land his Arm would be bowed, and his Leg stretcht out, that the Vessels may be elonged after extirpation, that you may the better take hold of them. <hi>Ambr. Par.</hi> proposes a more easie and sure way of deligation, that is, by passing the Needle with a good strong Thread through the skin, about half an inch above from the lips, your Needle to come out just by the side of the great Vessels, then pass your Needle from the other side over the Vessels within, through the Raw-flesh out through the skin; there putting a fold of a rag or of Emplaster spread, and tye the two ends of the thread over this straight; thus you bind the Artery and Vein with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable pain: But at Sea, I suppose, your actual Cauteries are always at such times in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by you: Therefore in such cases use them, they will secure your Patient from the present danger, and fortifie the part against future putrifaction, they requiring no such strict Bandage, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you shall fear interception of Spirits; when we Cauterize the Artery, we do then touch the end of the bone, it hastening the Exfoliation: The next thing is the loosening the Ligature, and bringing the lips close over the stump, then whether you should with a cross stitch hold them so, or content your self by Bandage as well as you can, is by some controverted; they that object against it say, it causes pain and inflamation, so doth Bandage, if it be made too straight; Therefore they should object against that also. The most that I have seen without cross stitch have the next dressing been broad stumps, some of them with lips turned outward by the Bandage: In the least of them the whole
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41836:125"/>stump hath been bare, whereas those where I have brought the lips over the stump, have been the next dressing close, covering the great Vessels, and a third or half part of the stump hath been well digested, and by the second dressing hath been near agglutinated, so far as it lay under that skin, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inflammation happily cured: Whereas the broad stump is a certain sign of a long Cure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly death. The exposing those incised parts too much to the Air, causes pain, and the want of native heat makes them gleet; or if they do digest, the discharge of so great a quantity of Matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly exhausts the Spirits of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>If the musculous flesh and skin was well pull'd up in time of Amputation, and brought over by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate extension, as far as they will easily admit, you will find it not painful; you are to pass the Needle with a strong brown-thread seared, you are to pass it about half an inch from the edges of the lips, having made them cross from side to side equally, tye them with a moderate astriction, then apply a Pledgit on the Cauterized Vessels with <hi>Pul. Irid. Suc. Cepar. &amp; Mel.</hi> But if no Cautery was used, then Buttons of Tow spread with your Restrictive, and dipt <hi>in Pulv.

But before you make this Bandage, you ought to apply your defensative over the parts above the stump: Some apply it before they begin the Ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but then it is found full of wrinkles, and sits uneasie. In the dressing of these stumps, you are to apply your medicaments, as you may without much bungle roul up the member, and place it to the ease of the Patient, one holding his hand some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while upon the stump: Your defensative may be of the same which is proposed in Gun-shot-wounds, or this; ℞. <hi>Far.

The Patient thus tired with pain desired to be cured, or have his Arm cut off: To which purpose he had procured the Governors leave for my staying with him. But while that <hi>Phlegmon</hi> was upon the upper parts, there was no hopes of a prosperous Amputation, nor of cure while those shivers of bones lay pricking the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts within the joynt: The <hi>Phlegmon</hi> was too forward for repercussion, and yet not likely to suppurate in less than a weeks time; therefore I endeavoured by Emollients and somewhat discuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, to succour the grieved shoulder and parts thereabout, by hindring the increase of the <hi>Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:41836:127"/>and give some perspiration to the part, then with good fomentations to corroborate the weak and oedematous member below, and by detergents, fomentation, and bandage to dispose the wound and fractured part to a better condition, and made way for discharge of Matter, and the shivers of bones, also to remove the <hi>Caries;</hi> to which end I had brought his hand nearer his breast: A few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I opened the Abscess above, and below under the <hi>Axilla;</hi> A while after, the Matter discharged from above, the tumor flatted and agglutinated within, and the Ulcer cured: But the continual pains stirr'd up in the fractured joynt, kept that opening in the <hi>Axilla</hi> from healing: The Patient growing weaker, and without hopes of cure, I was necessitated to proceed to the Amputation: To which purpose I sent to <hi>Chester</hi> for Mr. <hi>Morrey</hi> a knowing Chirurgeon,<note place="margin">Amputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> (since Mayor of that City) to come with Instruments and other necessaries whereby I might the better do the work. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> came, we prepared dressings ready, which were <hi>Stupa</hi> or Pledgits of fine short Tow well workt, some like the <hi>Splenia,</hi> others round bigger or less, these wet in Oxycrate and dried; also some but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of Tow, then compresses of Linnen-cloath dipt in Oxycrate, three or four Roulers with one or two heads, Needles threaded and seared for making the cross stitch, and lesser Needles thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for common use, with Filletting for Ligature, and Bladders ready cut and wet in Oxycrate. A defensative of the above-mentioned prescription, spread upon a soft Linnen-cloth, to apply upon the parts above more distant, and a mixture of the Astringent powders with whites of Eggs to spread upon the <hi>Splenia</hi> and buttons, which buttons were
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41836:127"/>also dipt in some of the same powder: Then for the round Pledgits which were designed to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied next to the stump; Mr. <hi>M.</hi> proposed that they might be spread with a mixture of <hi>Ʋmber</hi> and <hi>Calx viva,</hi> with whites of Eggs, according to Dr. <hi>Read</hi> in his observation upon an Amputation he performed upon a servant of the Lord <hi>Gerrards</hi> at <hi>Gerrards-Bromley,</hi> whose fame yet lives in that Country, and amongst us Chirurgeons, while his painful Lectures have a being.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Apparatus</hi> thus made, and the Patient some while before refresht with a draught of a good Caudle, his friends take him out of his bed, and place him in a Chair towards the light, one of his servants held his Arm, another of his friends his other hand, then Mr. <hi>Morrey</hi> drew up the skin and musculous flesh of the Arm towards his shoulder, whilest I made a strong Bandage some three or four fingers breadth above the affected part: Then with a good Knife I cut off the flesh by a quick turn of my hand, Mr. <hi>Morrey</hi> pulling up the flesh, whilest I bared the bone; then with a few motions of my Saw, I separated the bone, the Patient not whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering the while. After this Mr. <hi>Morrey</hi> thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands down-wards, with the musculous flesh and skin which he had drawn upwards, I with a strong Needle and Thread passed through the middle of the fleshy skin on both sides, within half an inch of the edges, and brought the skin close within a narrow compass, and having tied that fast, and cut off the string, I passed the Needle again through the two contrary sides, and this I tied as close; this is called the Cross-stitch, and is of so great use, as without the performance of this, the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41836:128"/>Patient is long in Curing; and sometimes through the great discharge of Matter the Spirits are wasted, <hi>Spasmaes</hi> and the like follow: Or if he do reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, 'tis a long work and much pains; whereas by this cross stitch the stump is covered to the breadth of a five shillings or half-crown piece, the flux of bloud in a good measure choakt, the heat of the part kept up, and the wound soon cured, and the Patient grows fat and strong: The while, having made this cross stitch, I untied the Ligature, and applied little round Stupes of Tow, which had been first dipt in Oxycrate, then dried, and spread with a Restrictive, wherein was a quantity of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> powder, mixt with <hi>Alb. Ovi.</hi> From these round ones I laid long Pledgits, spread with the powder of <hi>Ʋmber, &amp;c.</hi> mentioned by Dr. <hi>Reade</hi> in his Lectures; this and the long Pledgits were Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s. proposal, and sat very close from the middle of the stump each way upwards along the Arm; then I put on a Bladder, a cross-cloath, and rouled up the stump, and made a Bandage from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his other Arm, and over his Neck to this Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, (which prevented an accident which hath since happened to a Patient here in <hi>London,</hi> where many of the best Chirurgeons were concerned.) Then I put him into his bed, and three days after opening him, the wound was well digested, but the binding occasioned a new eruption of the Ulcer, which formerly came from the <hi>Phlegmon</hi> in the <hi>Axilla:</hi> Our stitches brought the skin so close to the stump, as here was no place for buttons with <hi>Escaroticks,</hi> which are so constantly used in these Operations, which lying commonly upon the new incised flesh, Nerves, and Tendons, do much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the quiet of the part.</p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:41836:128"/>
                     <p>The second dressing was made by a digestive of a little <hi>Terebinth.</hi> washt <hi>in decoct. Malvar.</hi> with the yolk of an Egg, and <hi>Ol.

                     <p>At the Siege of <hi>Weymouth</hi> I was called at break of day to an <hi>Irish</hi>-man of Lieutenant Coll. <hi>Ballard</hi>'s Regiment, who in shooting off his musquet, brake and tore his hand to pieces after a strange manner: I purposed to cut off his hand;<note place="margin">Observat.</note> I sent presently to my quarters to one of my Servants to bring a Saw, and Knife, and dressings, of which at those times we had always store, which being brought, I took a red ribbon from off my Case of Lancets, and bound about his Arm some four fingers above the <hi>Carpus,</hi> and cutting the flesh, bared the bones of their membrane; I divided the flesh between the bones, and setting the Saw close to the flesh above, I sawed it off, and untied my Ligature above, and bringing down the musculous flesh and skin over the end of the bone, not making any cross-stitch, here drest up that stump with my Restrictives, and rouled him up, and returned again to my quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: I had not been one hour gone, but I was sent for again to this <hi>Irish</hi>-souldier, he being as the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41836:129"/>messenger said grievously full of pain; I wondered at it, and hastened away, before I came to his hut, I heard him crying, I asked him what he ailed to roar so, it was a while before he would answer me, at last he told me he was not able to indure that red Ribbon that I tied his Arm with; I was at first herein surprized, to think I should leave the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon his Arm, that being a sure way to bring a mortification upon the part: I put my hand in my pocket, and shewed him the red Ribbon on the Case of Lancets, he seemed at first to doubt it, but after he see it was so, he laught; and was from that time in ease: Two days after our men were surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and chased out of the Town and Chappel-fort; I was at the same time, it being about twelve a clock, dressing the wounded in a house for that purpose in the Town, almost under the Chappel and Fort, I heard a woman cry, <hi>fly, fly,</hi> the Fort is taken: I turned aside a little amazed, towards the Line, not knowing what had been done; when I got upon the Line, I see our people running away, and those of the Fort shooting at them, I slipt down this Work into the ditch, and got out of the Trench; and as I began to run, I heard one call <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> I turned back, and seeing a man hold up his stump and his hand, I thought it was the <hi>Irish</hi>-man, whom I had so lately dismembred; I returned, and helpt him up, and we ran toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was within half musquet-shot of the enemies Fort, he out-ran me quite.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Fistulae.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Fistula</hi> according to the Vulgar denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is every sinuous Ulcer, if it have been but of two months continuance; but strictly saying those only are <hi>Fistulae</hi> which are narrow, sinuous, and have contracted a hard <hi>Callus,</hi> they are usually some years in making: The worst sort of these, at least that ever I see, was from Gun-shot-wounds with fracture; especially where there hath been loss of bones, or through long continuance the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> hath chambered the bone, the lips of the wound and wound become <hi>Callus</hi> by keeping long open in order to Exfoliation, and sometimes through former sinuosities which have prolonged the cure, there the lips grow hard, and do become inverted thick, and are more or fewer in number as the Abscess or wound was more or less sinuous: This <hi>Callus</hi> of the <hi>Fistula</hi> is hastened by the perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and resolution of the thin and subtil humors, and Incrassation of the more pituitous, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion of which a long pipe of skin is made, which brancheth itself inwards from the orifice quite through all the Cavities of the Ulcers, from whence it hath its name.</p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:41836:130"/>
                     <p>The differences of these <hi>Fistulae</hi> are made not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the parts affected,<note place="margin">Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> as some in fleshy, others in Tendonous, or in the bones, or joynts, or the breast, belly, &amp;c. But also from the figure, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and number of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> as sometimes only one, then again two or three crooked or winding, till they enter the bones themselves.</p>
                     <p>They are known by the Veiw, and by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the parts,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> or by searching with a Probe, and from the discharge of a thin serous Foetid Matter, and have an Arched hollowness: If by your searching the parts are pained, or a drop of bloud follows your Probe, the <hi>Fistula</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but if neither succeed, the <hi>Fistula</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Fistulaes</hi> are hard to cure,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick.</note> and those of long continuance with great discharge of depraved hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in sinuous parts amongst the bones and joynts are worst, because their <hi>Sinus</hi> are narrow, and have contracted a hard <hi>Callus,</hi> and without that be removed they can admit of no cure.</p>
                     <p>The way of Cure is performed by manual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or by Medicaments; But before you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in either, you are to consider that these <hi>Fistu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s are subject to pain and defluxion; wherefore you are in the first place to proceed by evacuating of those humors which may disturb you in your work, and that is done by purging and bleeding, good <hi>Traumatic</hi> decoction and observation of dyet, as is said in universal regiment.</p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:41836:130"/>
                     <p>To proceed to the Cure by manual operation,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> you are to consider the part affected, whether the <hi>Callus</hi> be only in the lips, or in some part of the <hi>Fistula,</hi> or that the <hi>Callus</hi> be throughout the whole length of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> and this is discovered as I have aforesaid by the Probe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If there be neither pain nor matter, the <hi>Fistula</hi> tending only down directly to the bone, then do you let it alone accounting it an imperfect <hi>cicatrix,</hi> and if undisturbed will in time grow more close; But if it be the former, then you must remove the <hi>Callus</hi> if you propose to cure it.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Sinus</hi> may conveniently be laid open, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it with Knife or Scissers the whole length; if after the laying it open, the <hi>Sinus</hi> be not <hi>Callus,</hi> or not a confirmed <hi>Fistula,</hi> then deterge the Ulcer and Incarn and cicatrize it: But if the orifice of the <hi>Fistula</hi> be streight and narrow, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay it open, you must then dilate it with Tents of Spunge, <hi>gentian, Aristolochia,</hi> Elder-pith, &amp;c. until the <hi>Sinus</hi> be large enough for your purpose; and to further this work it may be proper, that you out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly apply such Medicaments, as may by their Emollient and digestive quality resolve and dissipate the matter, impacted in the parts about, and these are <hi>Rad. Altheae. lilior. Enulae campan. Sigill. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomonis, cucumeris agrest. sem. lini, fenugraec. Medullae ossium, Axung. Porcinae, Axungiae Humanae, Anseris, Gallinae, dialthae. Gum. Galban. Amoniac.</hi> &amp;c. Of these you may make fomentations, Cataplasma's or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots: You have also to this purpose <hi>Empl. de ranis cum aut sine Mercurio, Empl. de Musilag. diacal.

I here after general Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation applyed a Caustick the whole length of the <hi>Sinus,</hi> whereby I took off that <hi>Callus,</hi> and gave way to the discharge of that Faetid <hi>Ichor</hi> made in the Bone, and took out several pieces of the rotten bone which was shut in there: This done, I Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd away that rottenness, and drest the Bone with my <hi>Cattagmatick</hi> powders, &amp;c. By which means after some time a <hi>Callus</hi> thrust forth, and United with the Musculous flesh, and after which by <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks</hi> Incarned, and was afterward cicatrized by <hi>Epiloticks,</hi> as is said in Ulcers of the Legs.</p>
                     <p>It often hapneth, that in the time of Exfoliation of <hi>Caries</hi> in the bones, where there hath been loss of bones, as in Gun-shot-wounds is too often seen, there while we are attending Exfoliation, the lips grow <hi>Callus,</hi> so as the Cicatrix is deep, and the lips at some distance.</p>
                     <p>In this case heretofore I have taken much pains to better the Cicatrize, but since by often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have found, that in time the Lips flat, and the <hi>Callus</hi> rises up to them of it self, and the Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize becomes firm and seemly.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Fractures in General.</head>
                     <p>A Bone is a Similar part of the Body, and the hardest, and dryest of all, the General use of which is <hi>Stabilimentum ac fundamentum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquis omnibus partibus largiri,</hi> to be a firm prop and foundation upon the strength whereof all the rest of the parts are built: The whole Skeliton consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered joyntly may be looked upon, as performing that office to the little world, that <hi>Atlas</hi> hath been fabulously reported to do to the great one; it bears the whole bulk of it, and sustains it in all its motions, none of which could be performed, if either the bones were not, or not so articulated and joynted, as upon desection they appear to be, <hi>Nam si ossa abessent non flecteremus manus non ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos &amp; fibras;</hi> nay if the least bone be but a little maimed, the use of the part is hindred, but they are not only <hi>fulcimenta,</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> sayes <hi>de usu parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, sed etiam defensio</hi> but also a defence. The <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium veluti Galea,</hi> as a helmet defends the Brain from external Injuries; So <hi>Pectus ossibus clauditur,</hi> the Heart, Lungs, and great vessel of the <hi>Thorax</hi> are guarded by a wall of Ribs; the <hi>Spina</hi> is a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark to the Marrow included in it, and such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41836:135"/>is the <hi>os pubis</hi> and the <hi>os coxa &amp; Ilion</hi> to the Womb and bladder; others otherwise serve the uses of Nature, as the three little Bones <hi>in meatu Auditorio</hi> by firming the <hi>Timpanum,</hi> are a great help to the hearing; the <hi>os hyodes</hi> assisteth the swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, by managing the root of the Tongue and the <hi>Epiglottis.</hi> The <hi>Rotula</hi> serves the motions of the Knee, and the Teeth prepare the meat by Masti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not a Bone but hath its particular end set out: There was a reason of the Temper, of the Magnitude, of the number, of the Substance, of the Scituation, of the Connection of them, the wise Creator as much shunning Superfluity as deficiency. Indeed the whole Fabrick is so full of Excellency that it would take up much time to express them; But that is not my business: The subject I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to treat of is their misfortune, and that is twofold, to be Fractured and Dislocated; that of Fractures I have proposed for my present Discourse, and that only in General, it being sufficient for my design.</p>
                     <p>To proceed Methodically, I shall begin with their definition, which according to <hi>Galen, de methodo medendi,</hi> Is <hi>unitionis sine continuitatis solutio quaecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que in osse,</hi> but this being too general, and taking in all cariosity and Ulcers of the Bones, which hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to this head of Chirurgery: The moderns have more closely defined it to be <hi>Ossis divisio seu rupturia à causa violenter irruente:</hi> But this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise seems to me to be lyable to many exceptions, I shall name only this, <hi>viz.</hi> That a cut made into a Bone by a sword or a sharp Instrument, seems to be rather a wound than a Fracture: And for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>Guido de Cautiaco</hi> makes it to be <hi>continuitatis solutio in osse non à re qualibet facta, sed ab ea qua
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41836:136"/>contundit;</hi> yet I must still beg pardon if I be not yet satisfied with this description, because it leaves out all such Fractures as are made by any accidental bowing of a Bone, either in a wrench, or any other case where without any blow or contusion of parts, the bone snaps in sunder, and then wounds the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Muscles, even to the thrusting of it self very often quite through the skin: These are (cases of Battail excepted) the most frequent of all Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet not without some violence to be reduced to any of these later definitions. I shall therefore chuse to define a Fracture in the following words,<note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Fractures.</note>
                        <hi>It is a solution of continuity in a Bone suddainly made, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by contusion or flexure:</hi> By contusion, I mean either a Blow by a blunt Instrument, or a pressure by a great weight, either of which usually bruiseth the flesh about the Bone, as well as the Bone it self: In contrafissures indeed the bruise is not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the Fracture, but in the places where the blow is given: In Flexure there is seldom any bruise but what is made by the edges of the Bone it self, after it is snapped in sunder; all other Fractures are reducible to these.</p>
                     <p>Amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> it was commonly known by the name of <hi>Catagma:</hi> I purpose not to trouble you with the nice distinctions in Fractures, nor yet with their various names. <hi>Galen</hi> in his Book <hi>de method. medendi</hi> complains, that in his time <hi>non desunt ex Medicis Junioribus qui ambitiosè omnes fractura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum differentias propriis nominibus interpretantur,</hi> there wanted not (saith he) young Physicians who affected to give proper names to all the several kinds of Fractures; <hi>At non Hippocrates hujus fuit senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae;</hi> nor shall I spend my time so; But according
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41836:136"/>to <hi>Galen</hi> do take the difference in Fractures to arise,<note place="margin">Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> 1. <hi>à figura.</hi> 2. <hi>à magnitudine.</hi> 3. <hi>ab ossium fracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum varietate:</hi> First from their Figure, it is either Right <hi>quae fit per longitudinem,</hi> or transverse <hi>per la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem,</hi> or oblique which is as it were compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the two former. Secondly, <hi>à magnitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> according as the Fracture is greater or lesser. The Third difference is <hi>ab ossibus ipsis,</hi> that is from the Bones themselves that are broken, whether it be the Arm, Leg, Ribs, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Causes of Fractures internal there are none,<note place="margin">Causes.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be <hi>ab humoribus corporis erodentibus,</hi> and of that sort you may read many in <hi>Skenkius, Fabr. Hildanus,</hi> and others: I my self have seen some, and lately, but these being from Erosion are rather to be called Ulcers with <hi>Caries,</hi> and therefore more fit to be discourst of amongst Ulcers of that kind, to which I refer you.</p>
                     <p>Of Causes external there are many, as the too violent assaults or strokes of all external things, which may bruise, break, shatter or bend. In this number of causes may also be reckoned falls from on high, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Signs of a Fracture without a wound are for the most part very evident;<note place="margin">Signs.</note> the <hi>first</hi> and most certain is, when in our handling it we feel the pieces of Bones sever'd a sunder, and hear them crackle: <hi>Secondly,</hi> the Impotency of the Member: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> vehement pain: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> a distortion of the part; also by comparing the one with the other, the Fractured Member being shorter. But if there be a wound joined to the Fracture, then if the Bones thrust themselves not forth, yet you may
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41836:137"/>easily know it to be Fractured, if you search with your finger or Probe. There is also a curvedness which may be reduced to Fracture; I have seen it in children often, as in D. <hi>C</hi>'s. little daughter in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s. Son in <hi>Black-fryars,</hi> and others: It is as it were when you break a green stick, it breaks but separates not, so is cured by a due Extention with little trouble to the Chirurgeon, or pain to the Patient after the Extension is made.</p>
                     <p>If the Fractures be <hi>secundùm longitudinem,</hi> it will appear first by the unnatural thickness of the Member, then by the pain and inequality of the part.</p>
                     <p>In Prognostick or presage,<note place="margin">Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks.</note> a Fracture of the Bones cannot be without danger, for of necessity the Solution of continuity must be great. If a wound be made in a fleshy part, the wound is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the weapon that made it, <hi>&amp; non ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra:</hi> But if the Bone be broken <hi>propter Rigiditatem &amp; continuitatem non potest frangi nisi totum franga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> The Fracture is more dangerous in a great bone than in a small, and the greater if the bones be broken, as the two Focills in the Leg or in the Arm, where the <hi>radius</hi> and <hi>ulna are;</hi> yet if in the middle of the bones, it is the less dangerous: Those in or near the Joint are more painful and difficultly cured, and if any shivers press upon the Nervous parts, ill accidents commonly follow. A Fracture with a wound is the most dangerous of all. As to the time of Cure, the lesser bones are perfected in 14, 18, or 25 daies; the bigger in 40, or 50, according to <hi>Guido:</hi> yet let me advise you not to be too hasty in taking them out of their Beds, for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41836:137"/>in some Bodies the generation of <hi>Callus</hi> is very slow, and a new distortion may happen, and ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents follow. I have been call'd in to consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon such an Accident, the Patient did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, but by lying so long within doors contracted such an ill habit of body, as was not got off in a long while after.</p>
                     <p>In the cure of Fractures, Unition is required; but that cannot be made, unless pain and Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be prevented; For a Fracture of the Bones is not made without an Internal wounding of the <hi>Periostium</hi> and parts next to it, whence grievous pain arises, which stirs up defluxion, and is attended often with great Inflamation, and from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Member many Excrements are made and received, which it is neither capable to assimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, nor yet expel; and the mischief is the greater, by how much the Bones lye deeper within the Muscles, where they cannot be set by reason of the great quantity of flesh, interposing between them and the hand of the Artist: The Intention pursued in this case is the union of Bones, as I have already said, which is not performed by the first Intention, unless it be in little children, but by the second, <hi>viz.</hi> an intervening of <hi>Callus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Method I thereto propose,<note place="margin">Intentions of Cure.</note> is first to joyn the fractured parts together; Secondly, to keep them so joyned; Thirdly, to preserve the Tone of the part; Fourthly, to generate <hi>Callus;</hi> Fifthly, to correct Accidents.</p>
                     <p>That parts may be rightly joyned together,<note place="margin">1 Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> there is need of <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Coaptation;</hi> for in fractures,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41836:138"/>especially transverse ones, the bones are commonly distorted, the rectitude of the Member lost, some parts are prominent, and others hollow, the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured bones lying one upon another, and so the Member made short, <hi>quia musculi perpetuo mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum trahunt versus suum principium:</hi> for which cause extension is necessary,<note place="margin">Extension.</note> that the parts which are indirect may be brought right, and the parts that stick out be reduced to their Cavities. And although sometimes, the Member seemeth not to be short, as if it consists of two bones and one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or that the Fractured bones do not lye one over another, nevertheless you ought to make due extension in all Fractures, because they never lye exactly equal, and most frequently they ride one over another; The want of which Extension is one reason, why the Fractured Thigh bones hap to be so often shorter than they should be, as <hi>Celsus</hi> hath it in these words, <hi>Si femur perfractum fuerit bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius erit;</hi> his reason is, <hi>Quia nunquam in antiquum statum revertitur:</hi> And I find in <hi>Galen,</hi> that <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> saies the same of the Leg and Arm, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tells us it is <hi>nisi ante confirmationem extensio debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta adhibeatur &amp; comodâ deligatione ossium coaptatio servetur;</hi> by which you may observe the fault is want of good Extension, and keeping the part in its right seat, else you shall hazard the starting again of the Bones, and thereby their Fractured ends may hap to be broken off, by mutual Attrition in the Act of joining together; and if they do chance to fall in again, between the Fractured bones, they will then hinder their uniting, and if those shivers slide outwardly towards the Membranes, they will cause extream pain; This Inconvenience is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be shun'd by the help of Extension, but again
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41836:138"/>in Extension, there must be observed a mean, as <hi>Vigo</hi> notes to us, <hi>ad magnam quidem Extensionem futurus spasmus valde suspectus est.</hi> Yea sometime the very Muscles are torne a sunder, as <hi>Galen</hi> tells us, and <hi>Albucasius</hi> cries out <hi>cave extensionem vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentem &amp; compressionem fortem sicut faciunt multi stolidorum, multoties enim faciunt Apostema calidum &amp; contractionem in membro;</hi> by which it seems in his time there was such a people, who thereby drew sad accidents, as Convulsions and Inflamations upon their Patients: But yet if the Extension be less than it should, then as I said before the ends of the bones rub one against another, and are broken or not seated in their proper place; Therefore the bigger bones having large Muscles, which draw the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber forceably to their original, do require the stronger Extension, and such are the Thighs, Legs and Arms; and if both the Focills be broken, the more Extension the <hi>Radius</hi> requires, lest because it hath no Muscles to draw it upwards, its motion being only <hi>secundum pronum &amp; supinum:</hi> In Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it behoves us to observe <hi>debitam figunationem,</hi> that the Member be extended <hi>in ea figura quae mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum facit dolorem</hi> saith <hi>Galen,</hi> which is done if the Fibres of the Muscles be stretcht, according to their rectitude; children and such as are of a soft habit of body do best suffer Extension, elderly and dry bodies the contrary.</p>
                     <p>In the next place is to be considered the most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable time to reduce the Fractures,<note place="margin">When to be made.</note> and herein we all agree, the sooner the better, and that to avoid the Inflamation according to <hi>Celsus, Si in primis diebus non restauratur, Inflamatio oritur, sub qua difficile &amp; periculosa vis Nervis adhibetur:</hi> If at
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41836:139"/>the first or second day the Fracture be not reduced, it is in danger of Inflamation and Mortification, for indeed after the second day its supposed, the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is accompanied with great defluxion, so yields not to Extension, without hazard of drawing such ill accidents upon it self.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>Fallop.</hi> in his exposition upon <hi>Hipocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes de Capitis vulneribus,</hi> and by his Authority tells us what we shall do in such a case, <hi>Si os non fuerit in suo loco,</hi> saies he, <hi>Ideo ad septimam, qui est pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Terminus Inflamationis, vel usque ad nonam, qui est secundus, debemus bene advertere, &amp; oportet Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedire Inflamationem,</hi> if the bone was not restored before the time of Inflamation, then we ought to attend till the seventh day, which is the first period of the Inflamation, or until the ninth day, which is the second period, and all this time we ought to restrain the defluxion, <hi>vel per lenitionem doloris vel expressionem &amp; deligationem loci, lenimus autem Medicamentis, oleosis quae habent vim refrigerandi, per deligationem pluribus fasciis,</hi> either by lenient Medicines, or by deligation: We lenifie with soft cooling oyls, we make our deligation or Bandage by many turns of the roulers, these are to be done until the Seventh or Ninth day; Inflamation abating there is opportunity for reducing the Fracture: The Instruments for Extension are threefold. First, the Chirurgeons hand for gentle Extension;<note place="margin">Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Extension.</note> and let him place his hand near the Fracture, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he shall hurt the sound part, by too much compression, and not avail himself much in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension; Secondly, for the middle Extension are <hi>funes</hi> and <hi>habenae,</hi> a sort of Bandage fit to pluck at in order to Extension. Thirdly; are <hi>organa &amp; machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namenta</hi> Engins used often by us, but invented by
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41836:139"/>the Ancients, and they are for the most strong Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension; but before you make your Extension, consider whether the Member be not Fractured in more places than one. An old Gentleman came out of the Countrey, by a fall going down <hi>Ludgate-hill,</hi> breaks his Right Arm a little above the wrist trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and near the bending of the Arm a second Fracture oblique, this double Fracture hath hapned to others in the Leg, it requires your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, lest the one escape your sight, and the Member left deformed and weakned in its Action.</p>
                     <p>The Extension made;<note place="margin">2 Coapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the Extenders are to be loosed gently, and the Operator shall with his hand endeavour as gently to press down the ends of the Bones, and joyn them smooth and even together; and if there be any little Shiver, that will not be placed even with his fellows, cut upon it, and take it out, you shall know the perfect Coaptation of parts by these Signs; First,<note place="margin">Signs of good Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptation.</note> if the fractured Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber answer to the sound; Secondly, if by your handling of it you feel no inequality; and Thirdly, if pain be abated.</p>
                     <p>The Second Intention in Curing of Fractures is,<note place="margin">2 Intention</note> that the parts brought together may so be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, and that is performed by Bandage, which ought to be so made, as not only to keep the parts so joyned together, but to defend them from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation; and to this purpose I commend to you that of <hi>Hip.</hi> and from my own practice. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of 3 Roulers made of Linnen Cloath, not too coarse, lest by its hardness it offend the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, nor yet too soft and fine, lest it break;<note place="margin">1 Rouler.</note> with the first Rouler you are to begin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fracture, and take three turns, then roule up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41836:140"/>to the sound part, and so at the upper-part end this Rouler; it will steady the fracture a little, until the other Bandage be made, and restrain the influx of humors which might cause inflamation.</p>
                     <p>And the second Rouler as long again as the first, must be rouled contrary to the first;<note place="margin">Second Rouler.</note> so as if the first was made to the right hand, then this must be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the left: So that if the Muscles by the first Bandage were wreathed too much on one side, they now may be restored again to the other. This se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Rouler begins upon the fracture, and after a turn there is carried downwards, that so you may press the influx of humor from the fractured part, and so having made three or four turns downward upon the sound part, you may roul upward again by the fracture, and making a circumvolution upon the fracture itself, pass upwards, until you come to the end of the first Rouler. And there <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> terminates this second Bandage, because there is fear of the descent of humours <hi>à parte supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori,</hi> and these two Bandages do more defend the part from inflamation, than strengthen the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; but they being made. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> puts over them (about the fracture) compresses of Linnen-cloath three or four times doubled, of such length as to reach over the fracture,<note place="margin">Splenia.</note> but so narrow, as that five or six might be placed over about the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, the distance of a finger one from another, and are to spread with a little <hi>Cerot,</hi> only to make them stick; these are called <hi>Plagulae</hi> and <hi>Splenia</hi> from their figure, and do supply the absence of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinative Medicaments, and lessen pain by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the compression of the Bandage.</p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:41836:140"/>
                     <p>The third Rouler of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> fastens the said Compresses;<note place="margin">Third Rouler.</note> and its first turn is made upon the fracture, the one head is carried upwards, and the other downwards: And you are to take notice, that the Bandages are to be drawn more straight upon the fractured parts than elsewhere, that the fractured part being more weak may be kept from defluxions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celsus</hi> in his Eighth Book and Tenth Chapter,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Celsus</hi>'s way of rouling.</note> proposes another way of Bandage, first he dips a cloath in red Wine and Oyle, and applied it over and about the fracture, and after he brings six Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, his two first are those of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and so rouled, over them, he brings a broad Linnen-cloath, spread with <hi>Cerot,</hi> to keep them close down, and because the fractured bone hath always a propensity that way, whither it tended when fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured; therefore saith he, You are always to put a Compress of Linnen-cloath dipt in Wine and Oyle, <hi>Ei parti quae contraria est parti in quam mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum inclinat,</hi> and over this he brings the four remaining roulers; so as the following rouler be rouled contrary to the former, and the third end <hi>in inferiori parte,</hi> in the lower part, <hi>reliquae omnes in superiori terminum habeant,</hi> all the rest end above.</p>
                     <p>These are the Bandages of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> men of the greatest authority in Chirurgery, and are followed almost by all that have writ since, and are of excellent use in fractures, in and near the Joynts, where there is fear of inflamation: But then in your Binding you must observe such a mean, as consists with the ease of the member
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41836:141"/>bound.<note place="margin">Sign of good Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</note> A small and lax tumor appearing at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the member a day after, is a sign of good Bandage; but if there appear no tumor, or if the swelling be great and hard, then the Bandage is nought; the first shewing the Bandage not to be straight enough, and the last too straight, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you should often visit your Patient, to inform your self how the Bandage is.</p>
                     <p>But if no accident happen, you shall not unbind the fracture until the seventh day;<note place="margin">Bandage, when to loosen.</note> and then if all be well, the Bandage will begin to slack of it self, and that is one reason, why fractures should be opened about that time; another cause may be, for that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in fractures there is an intolerable itching through the detension of humors, which are made sharp by deligation, perspiration being thereby hindred, and is wont to terminate in a most pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful excoriation and inflamed redness: And in this case you are to bath the affected part with warm water, that the Matter may be evaporated, and then the member is to be bound up again; but now at this time you are to put <hi>Ferulae</hi> or Splints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the <hi>Splenia</hi> or Compresses, but in fractures with great contusion, or in and near the Joynts, there I have continued the use of Compresses wet in white of Eggs; during the whole cure, with good success: And lately a youth about ten years of Age, labouring under a Carious Ulcer in his foot, the last great frost brake his Thigh-bone, according to the length of the member: This fracture was drest by my <hi>Emplast, è Bolo</hi> with <hi>Splenia,</hi> moistened with <hi>Albumin. ovor.</hi> this with Bandage, &amp;c. as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in this Treatise, confirmed the <hi>Callus;</hi> Mr. <hi>Yowell,</hi> sometimes a servant of mine, set his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41836:141"/>Thigh-bone for me, I being at that present other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise imployed. But all the Ancients, after the seventh day did use Splints, and so have I where they might safely be used; for they not only keep the member steady, but straight, and of these some are made of Tin, others of Scabboard, Pastboard, and of wood sowed up in Linnen-cloaths; those of Tin do very well by reason of their lightness; those of Scabboards are apt to bow, and so is the thickest Pastboard, especially if they chance to be wet; and those of Wood are heavy and apt to inflame the member, yet through the Artists care they may be all used with good success, yea from the first day of the fracture: As in the case of a Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, who brake both the Focils of his left Leg, within a few fingers breadth of the Ankle: This person laboured under an <hi>Astma,</hi> which grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously shaked the fractured member, wherefore I was necessitated to put on <hi>Ferulae</hi> the very first dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and continued the use of them during the whole time of his cure; he lately told me that he never felt the least pain in that Leg, since I took off the last Emplaster, which is more than ten years since. But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> used them not until the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, for before that day there was more need of hindring the inflamation, than of strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fracture, <hi>post septimam contra,</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the contrary is required.</p>
                     <p>The third Intention in curing of fractures is in preserving the tone of the part;<note place="margin">Third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note>
                        <hi>Natura enim os unire nequit nisi pars sit sana,</hi> Nature cannot knit the bones while the parts are distempered, and that cannot presently be removed; for though fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red parts be very well set, yet there will remain
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41836:142"/>some <hi>Cavernulae,</hi> which will be apt to fill with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and the part through its weakness can neither well assimilate nor expel, so is like to be burdened with Excrementitious humors: Therefore Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy may be here of especial use, and the keeping of the belly soluble by Clysters, or otherwise, and a slender diet prescribed; but this is the work of a Physician. Yet they not being alway at hand, I thought fit to mention it, and so to proceed to our own work, in keeping up the tone of the part, and hereto we have need of such medicines. <hi>Quae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriam influxam desiccant &amp; inflammationem repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt,</hi> which dry up serosities and repel inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And these in a word are <hi>Astringentia,</hi> of which we have choice. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> he used <hi>Cerot,</hi> then red Wine; <hi>Celsus,</hi> you have heard, he used Wine and Oile; others used Oile of Mirtils, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, red Wine, and whites of Eggs together; others again used whites of Eggs alone; and others added oils of <hi>Myrtill. Balaust. Ros. Rubr. Sang. Dracon. Bol. Armen.</hi> with a little Oil and Wine made up to the consistence of a linement, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon cloaths over the fracture. By the use of this latter medicament, I cured a man whose Arm was sore bruised and fractured in many pieces, by the fall of a piece of Cannon, which brake loose in a storm, while we were preparing to lay aboard our enemy; over this Restrictive I applied the <hi>Splenia</hi> of double soft Lining with Bandage, as in Compound Fractures, and happily cured him. If the inflamation be not great, I then take off the <hi>Empl. Diapalma,</hi> and some of the forementioned powders, with a little oile of Myrtles and Vinegar, made up to the consistence of an Emplaster. This I call my <hi>Empl. de Bolo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Empl. de Bolo.</note> which I spread upon cloath
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41836:142"/>pretty thick, and apply over the fracture, and this not only restrains the defluxions, but strengthens the fracture: They are all very good, if they be proportioned to the malady, and excellently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the tone of the part.</p>
                     <p>There is yet farther requisite to the performance of this Intention,<note place="margin">Position of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</note> position of the member, and that according to <hi>Gallen, debet esse mollis,</hi> the hurt part ought to lye soft, for that hard lying presses and causes pain and inflamation, <hi>debet esse aequalis ne distorqueat,</hi> it must lye smooth or equal, because an uneven scite distorts or draws a-wry the part; <hi>Sursum versus ne humores descendant,</hi> it should lye somewhat high, lest a painful defluxion fall upon it; <hi>Oportet congruam membri sigurationem conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare,</hi> It behoves, saith <hi>Hildanus,</hi> to consider the convenient figure of the member, that the Muscles be kept in their right scite, which is most free from pain, <hi>haec autem est figura media,</hi> which if it be not observed, <hi>Exiguo post tempore membrum dolere so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let;</hi> What those pains are you possibly may guess, but no tongue can express, therefore you ought to handle the member very tenderly, and if the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture be made <hi>in cubito,</hi> place it in a Case made of Pastboard, with a soft pillow under it, and bring it up to the breast with a fine Towel, or the like: But if it be the Leg that is fractured, we then place it in a bed, and in a Cradle, or upon a Pillow quilted in the midst with Juncks to support it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a special care, that the hollow of the Ham and Heel be fill'd up, lest the weight of the Foot hurt the Heel, from whence grievous pain doth ensue, and sad accidents may, as some of us have seen, or at large may read in <hi>Fabr. Hildanus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:41836:143"/>
                     <p>The fourth Intention is <hi>Callum Generare,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fourth Intention.</note> to make <hi>Callus,</hi> which is to be endeavoured after the fear of inflamation is over, <hi>Quia natura partis laesa non potest Callum Generare,</hi> and that ceaseth <hi>circa diem septimam,</hi> about the seventh day sooner or later, and if after that time the fracture is to be set, <hi>possunt diversa &amp; mala accidentia generari,</hi> saith <hi>Vigo,</hi> yet after the seventeenth day of the fracture, I have set the Thigh-bone, and cured the Patient, who is living without any ill accidents.</p>
                     <p>How the <hi>Callus</hi> is made, you may read at large in <hi>Fallopius,</hi> in his exposition on <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and though it be not bone it is so hard, saith he, that if the member hap again to be broke, <hi>potius in alia parte frangitur quam ubi Callus est Genitus,</hi> it breaks any where rather than in the <hi>Callus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two things are therefore required: First, that it's to be supplied with fit matter. Secondly, That that matter be not wasted from the edges of the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured bones, <hi>aut foras evocetur,</hi> saith <hi>Galen;</hi> as for the matter to make <hi>Callus,</hi> most Authors do agree,<note place="margin">Diet for the ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of <hi>Callus.</hi>
                        </note> that there be a greater liberty in diet; <hi>At quo tempore</hi> (saith <hi>Galen) Callus gignitur, nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum corpus est cibis boni succi, &amp; qui multum nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triant,</hi> and that viscuous, his reason is, <hi>Quia ossis alimentum crassum,</hi> and thenceforth they commend at this time offall of flesh, and broaths of Kid and Veal, and the like which are boiled with Rice or Wheat; they also allow sweet Wines: But this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in diet I think is better forborn, for thereby we often see great obstructions arise, especially here, where our Patients are inclinable to feed plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully; therefore in such fractures, where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:41836:143"/>is constrained to keep his bed, I propose a slender diet, and of such things as are of easie dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, for without that liberty surely we cannot fail to compleat our cure; the bones having natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a poriness in them, in which is always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a matter fit for their nourishment, and <hi>ex illo ipso nutrimento in fracturis Generatur Callus,</hi> of that nourishment <hi>Callus</hi> is made: So if you be careful to prevent inflamation, and the like mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, which disturb nature in her actions, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply such remedies as may dry the proper nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into <hi>Callus,</hi> we shall not fail then of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and they according to <hi>Galen</hi> ought to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plastick and moderately hot; for saith he, <hi>Ea Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los tum promovent, tum augent; quae digerendi vim obtinent, ea magnos jam Callos diminuunt:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves us with care to fit our Medicines to the age and constitution of our Patients: For those which are proper for men of ripe age, if applied to children and tender bodies, would so dry the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> as it would quite diminish it, and frustrate our cure: In children <hi>Albucasius</hi> commends to us whites of Eggs alone, or with a little <hi>Farina Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis;</hi> In those of more years, <hi>Pul. Myrrhae, Aloes, Acatiae, Gum Tragacant Thuris, Labdani, &amp;c.</hi> the Emplasters of <hi>Paracels. Diapalmae, Oxycroceum,</hi> severally or mixt: But this latter <hi>Vigo</hi> is very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with, and says 'tis a Diabolical Emplaster, too hot for the Summer, and not very proper for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; <hi>Vigoes</hi> Emplaster, <hi>ad ossium fracturas</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and so is our <hi>Catagmaticum</hi> in the <hi>London-Dispensatory.</hi> As to Internal medicines there are many, but I shall only recommend to you <hi>Ostrecol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and that by the authority of <hi>Fabr. Hildanus,</hi> who often experienc'd it, its Dose ʒ j. <hi>in Aq. Rad.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:41836:144"/>Simplyti,</hi> and with this so given, he cured a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Fracture in one above sixty years of age, <hi>at in juvenibus &amp; succulentis non putat convenire osteocollam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have proposed fit materials for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Callus;</hi> now lest that the matter of which it is to be generated should be hindred from thrusting forth, it behoveth you to alter the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, the member not to be rouled now so straight; by which means the nutritious juices will have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to flow in, and there by gradual digestion to thicken into a <hi>Callus:</hi> In the opening it, you are to consider whether the <hi>Callus</hi> generated be such as is required, how the fault of the <hi>Callus</hi> is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, if it be less or greater than it should be, you shall hear presently.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have done with Fractures in General, which if they be Simple, whether transverse, or <hi>secundum longitudinem,</hi> are cured by the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, only those which are <hi>secundum longitudinem</hi> require a more strict Bandage, otherwise the bones will be apt to gape: I hasten to the fifth Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>
                     <p>Which is correcting of those accidents, which happening in Fractures retard their cure,<note place="margin">Fifth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> and they are many; as Pain, Inflamation, Aposthumation, Gangrene, Itching, Excoriaton, <hi>Callus</hi> more or less than should be, weakness of the member and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved figure: If Pain invade the place, then Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents are proper, and such as restrain defluxion, and hinder inflamation, and of which sort I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned some, and for more variety, refer you to those who have written of a <hi>Phlegonon.</hi> If Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:41836:144"/>appear, slacken your Bandage, and foment the part with a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> in which hath been boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Scordium Absinth. Centaur.</hi> and the like, and you may apply over all a <hi>Cataplasma</hi> with Barley-meal, Lupines, with the tops of the forementioned Herbs, and the like powdered, adding Oxymell to it: But if Itching affect the part, then foment the part with warm water, which will give a breathing to it by the pores, or with salt-water, <hi>Quae propter salem expurgat &amp; poros aperit;</hi> the Itching neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, is wont to terminate <hi>in excoriationem dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosam,</hi> a very painful excoriation, <hi>cui occurrendum est exsiccantibus &amp; refrigerantibus,</hi> such are <hi>Ʋng. Album, Camph. Nutritum, Populeon, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Callus,</hi> it is sometime just, sometimes greater or lesser than just; if it be too great,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Callus</hi> to lessen.</note> you will perceive it by its bunching out; as also it will be painful to the touch or pressure, and besides it renders the part unapt for motion; in this case abate his diet, and make your Bandage more strict, and foment with discutients, and apply <hi>Emp. de Cicutâ, de Ranis cum Mercurio, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Callus</hi> be less, the signs are <hi>quod ad motum redditur debilis,</hi> the bone is weak, and if the part be toucht you scarce feel the <hi>Callus;</hi> and this was thought by the Ancients to proceed from slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of diet, or that it was not enough incrassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Callus</hi> to encrease.</note> But I think it rather proceeded from impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per applications, or too straight Bandage; yet if the Patient be in years, and of a spare body, you may both increase and incrassate his diet, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al slacken your Bandage, and invite forth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors by warm water, not too hot; <hi>donec pars ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bescat
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41836:145"/>&amp; in tumorem attollitur,</hi> untill the parts a little swell <hi>tunc enim desistendum:</hi> But if the member be extenuated, it's either from the too straight Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or over-much bathing with warm water; therefore you must now bath with fresh broaths, and good Embrocations, also a Pitch-plaster appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and presently pulled off again, will by its adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the hair and skin cause pain, and also an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of aliment to the part, and so the member is nourished.</p>
                     <p>Also after the fracture is cured, the member is too oft found to be of a depraved figure, by reason the bones were not well set, or through ill Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, or some inordinate motion, <hi>aut propter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scitiam Chirurgi.</hi> To help this, if the Patient be young and lusty, and the <hi>Callus</hi> but six months old; There is, saith <hi>Celsus,</hi> yet one refuge, that is, <hi>fracturam de novo rumpere;</hi> and in order thereunto, you are to foment the part with decoctions, <hi>ex Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaeâ, Cicuta,</hi> and then <hi>rursus os frangitur manibus vel digitis, impellendo seu comprimendo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Callus</hi> be yet so hard, as it yields not, then says <hi>Fab. ab Aq. Pend. Frango eum instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento attrahente in diversas partes:</hi> But this <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucasius</hi> a Chirurgeon, as bold as any, and one that had seen the effects of such rash undertakings, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemns; says it is <hi>operatio valde vitupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis perducens ad mortem:</hi> So advises the Patient, not to give ear to such vain people, but content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with such help as Emollients, Decoctions, Linements, and Emplasters may effect, which in truth is safer, if you consider that after the <hi>Callus</hi> is so confirmed, as it yields not to extension, than
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41836:145"/>I say if you should break it anew, or any other way separate it; yet it would no more yield to a right coaptation, than a Hare-lip or my two fingers will to agglutination, without separating their dry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is not possible to be done in Bones.</p>
                     <p>I could here insert many of my Cures in Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of particular parts,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> but it would signifie little more than I have already written, their cure consisting in the very same extension and coaptation, and are subject to no other Accidents: all which I have writ as plainly and feelingly, as if I had been performing the work in your presence. Yet as a rarity I shall tell you, that in <hi>Bridewell</hi> some years before the Fire, I was sent for to a poor Widow inhabiting there, whose little Son, of about eight years of age, playing about the Wharf, was struck by one of those great Cart-horses full in the face, striking the <hi>Ethmoides</hi> quite in from the <hi>os Cribri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,</hi> without any great wound: The Boy lay for dead a while, and dozed longer; it appeared a strange sight at first to me, his face beaten in, and the lower Jaw sticking out, nor did I presently know how to help him; by what Art to make my extension; But after a while, he a little recovering his senses, was perswaded to open his mouth. There I see the <hi>os Palati</hi> and <hi>Ʋvula</hi> carried so close back, that it was not possible for me to get my finger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and other way of extension there was none: Upon which I presently formed an Instrument bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up at one end, by which I got up behind the <hi>Ʋvula,</hi> then raising it a little upward, pull'd it forward with the <hi>Ethmoides</hi> into its former place very easily; but I no sooner let go my extender, than the Body returned back again: Upon which
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41836:146"/>I contented my self in dressing up the face with a restrictive <hi>Cerot</hi> to prevent influx of humors, and let him bloud, and within few hours after caused an Instrument to be made, whereby the great fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Body was more easily brought into its natural place, and also kept there by the hand of the Child, his Mother and my Servants helping him some while, other way there was none. Thus by their and our care, the Tone of the part was preserved, and a <hi>Callus</hi> thrust forth, which as it hardened, the part grew stronger, and the face restored to a good shape, better than could have been hoped from such a distortion in that place. The Patient is yet alive and well.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I done with that which concerns Simple Fractures.<note place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Fractures.</note> In a fracture with a wound, if neither the bone be bare, nor yet prominent through the skin, then you are by extension to bring the fractured ends of the bone together, as was proposed in the first and second Intention of Simple Fractures; and the lips of the wound are likewise to be brought together by Suture, if it be any-whit large, and not too much contused; which manner of dressing is contrary to what is taught in Gun-shot-wounds with fracture; the methods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be altered upon that occasion, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons there alledged. Then endeavour as in our third Intention, to keep the fractured and wounded parts together by dressings, which may as well mittigate the pain, as keep off apostemation, by repelling the matter flowing to the part, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that already flown, <hi>Qualia sunt Astringentia, Glutinantia,</hi> of which sort I have sufficiently offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, in the Discourse of Simple Fracture.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41836:146"/>
                        <hi>Galen,</hi> by the authority of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Cerot of Roses, but if their be no pain, you are to endeavour the strengthening of the fracture, and preventing defluxions by cloaths spread, with that composition of Astringent powders mixt with the whites of Eggs and red Wine, which is already proposed: Then follows deligation of the part, and in this case Bandages are to be made of softer and broader Linnen than we use in fractures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wound, that it may comprehend both the lips of the wound, and keep them down, yet not hurt them by its too hard compression, <hi>Minus Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendae sunt fasciae quam si vulnus non adesset,</hi> says <hi>Celsus,</hi> and therefore it is that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Celsus</hi> make so many Circumvolutions: <hi>cum meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us sit saepe circumire quam astringere,</hi> (saith <hi>Celsus</hi> again) The third day they loose the Bandage, then <hi>ferulae vel non apponendae ne vulnus comprimant,</hi> saith <hi>Albucasis;</hi> or if they be put on, <hi>super vulnus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni non debent;</hi> rather in these fractures do we use deligation, <hi>pluribus fasciis</hi> with many Roulers, saith <hi>Albucasis;</hi> and so all along he goes in his Sermons of Fractures, as if he had been rather bred under <hi>Hippocrates</hi> or <hi>Celsus</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> than where he was; But in truth this way of deligation is not only very troublesome to the Chirurgeon, to put on and off, but so very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Patient, that it is almost impossible that he should ever be without a Fever, if his wound be every day to be so roul'd and unroul'd: Therefore in these Compound Fractures we chuse rather to follow the method of some of the Moderns, who instead of these many long Roulers, make choice of two or three short cloaths, folded three or four times to give them the more strength, and of such
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:41836:147"/>breadth as to encompass the lips of the wound and fractured parts, and of that length as to come once about the fracture, and so stitch together on the most convenient side; and under these may be placed Compresses of fine Tow or double cloaths, which will not only keep the lips of the wound down, but fill up the inequality, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the expulsion of Matter: And so the wound may be drest, and the fractured member relieved at your pleasure, without giving the Patient the pain to have the fractured member removed, or your self the trouble in rouling and unrouling so many long Roulers as the Ancients proposed; and with this method I have cured Arms and Legs, so shattered by Splinters from Cannon shot, and with such loss of substance, as I even despaired of their Cure. But in some of these I have made use of <hi>Hippocrate's Plagulae,</hi> and often for the more strengthening the shattered member, have been glad to make use of some Splints, from the first day, but so as their compression was gentle and equal, and so placed, that the lips of the wound might be kept even, and that the discharge of Matter was by them furthered: But if the wound be transverse, it then requires more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, lest the Matter should at any time be prest back into the wound, and so not only dilate it, but foul the bones: Thus much for a Fracture with a wound, where the bones are not exposed to the Air, but if the bone be bare, and thrust it self out of the wound, and yet is again restored to its place, then let the wound be stitcht and drest, as I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to you even now in the Compound Fracture.</p>
                     <p>A Commander at Sea valiantly fighting in the midst of the enemies Fleet,<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> his Leg was fractured
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:41836:147"/>by the fall of his Mizon-Top-Mast, it breaking his Leg transverse near the Ankle, the edge of the bone thrusting out through the skin. He not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the bone then presently to be set while it was warm, afterwards being swell'd and stiff, it did not yield to extension, but became painful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed: After some few days he was brought to <hi>London,</hi> I was sent to him, he was of an ill habit of Body, subject to the Gout and dysenteries, and the Fracture accompanied with great defluxion, not in a condition to admit of Extension; therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Falopius</hi> upon <hi>Hippocrates</hi> cited by me in this Treatise, I proposed to his Chirurgeon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by Lenients, to mitigate pain, Inflamation, and by Bandage to hinder defluxion, which we did, and his Chirurgeon continued that method a few days: The Accidents gone off, Mr. <hi>Arris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer,</hi> and my self, met Mr. <hi>Pearce</hi> his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's Chirurgeon at the Patients Lodging, with the Chirurgeon of the Ship, we find the Patient in ease, taking off the dressings we see the Member in good temper, we agree to make Extension and reduce the Fracture, the Patient was of a dry tough Body, the Member yielding difficultly to Extension, we satisfied our selves with what we had done, doubting that upon a more forcible Extension, ill Accidents might follow (as an Inflamation presently did) we drest it up as a Compound Fracture, so as the wound was daily drest, and after some while a <hi>Callus</hi> thrust forth and united the Bones. That <hi>Callus</hi> confirmed and dried, we hastned the Exfoliation of the bare Bone, by a little <hi>Aegyptiacum &amp; pul myrrhae</hi> disolved in <hi>sp. vini</hi> applyed hot upon an Armed Probe: Thus the Bone was Exfoliated and the Ulcer cured by the ordinary Intentions required
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41836:148"/>in them. Yet that inward leaning of the Bone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a weakness a long-time, as is usual where the Fracture hath not been timely reduced. To supply this, I cause a Bar to be fixed in his Shooe with Joints, this by a Bandage strengthned his Leg, whether he hath yet left it off I know not: But if the end of the bared Bone have thrust it self so our, as that without great force it cannot be restored to its place, <hi>Tunc è duobus malis minus est eligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendum,</hi> then that end of the Bone which hath thrust it self so far out is to be Sawed off, and if this be done timely before a Gangrene hath seazed upon the parte it may be performed with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
                     <p>In St. <hi>Clements</hi> parish behind the Church, some years since one Evening while I was preparing my dressings for the Setting a Fractured Thigh bone in a little Child, I was presently fetcht to assist one Mr. <hi>P.</hi> a Barber-Chirurgeon in the Setting a Fracture of both the Focils of the Leg in a man of about Sixty years of Age, of a Tough dry body.<note place="margin">Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> There I met Mr. <hi>Tatham</hi> an endustrious knowing Chirurgeon, the Fracture was oblique almost <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum longitudinem,</hi> and the <hi>os Tibiae</hi> or greater Focil had shot it self out by the inside of the Ankle a great length; we endeavoured by a strong Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Reduce this Fractured Bone into its place, but the bone yielded very difficultly to our Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: Yet we reduced it, then cleansed the wound of what we met of the Shivers or pieces of Bones, and brought the Lips of the wound together by Suture, hoping thus to keep the Fractued Bone the closer. Then we drest the wound with our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestive warm, and with an Emplaster of <hi>diacalc.</hi>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:41836:148"/>malaxt with <hi>ol. Ros.</hi> over it a mixture of <hi>flor. Ros. rub. Balaust. Baccar. myrt. Bol. Armen. sang. drac. pulverizat. cum albumine ovor. ol. Ros. &amp; acet. m. ad consist. mellis:</hi> This spread upon a double cloath, and applyed over the Fractured Member and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Bandage as hath been proposed in compound Fractures; but for the more strengthening the Fractured Member, we put on <hi>Ferulae</hi> with soft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses between them and the first Bandage, and having fastned them by three Ligatures, we placed the Member as much to the ease of the Patient as we could contrive, upon a Pillow quilted in the the middle with Juncks to keep it steddy; but these great Fractures with large wounds and near the Joint, are always subject to grievous pain; and this much more, for that the Tendons and Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous flesh was sore bruised, and stretcht by the great Extension, so was not likely to be attended with less mischief than afterward befell it: We Let him bloud that night and gave him an <hi>Anodyne</hi> draught to dispose him to Rest, but he slept little his pains continuing with much disturbance; a fever followed, and within two or three daies he became delirous, and in the absence of his attendance got out of Bed, the great Focil flew out as at first, and the poor man fell down on the floor as half dead; We were both presently fetcht, we took off the dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and see the Bone distorted, the lower Stitches broken, and the wound of an ill Aspect, it tending to mortification without hopes of being any more reduced by a new Extension. Upon which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we resolved to Saw the end of it off, and to that purpose having prepared all things ready, we cut out the remaining Stitches, and turned the foot on one side towards the small of the Leg, thrusting
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:41836:149"/>the Bone more out; the one Sawing the end off whilst the other with a <hi>Spatula</hi> defended the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous flesh underneath from being wounded by the Saw: That done we cleansed the wound from the Saw-dust and Shivers of little Bones, which we had not discovered in our first dressing, they lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der between the distorted Bone and Membranes, by which those sad Accidents had been hastened: The wound thus cleansed we turned the foot right in to its natural place, there being no need of Extension: The great work was now, how to support the foot and keep it even with the Leg, there being so great a distance between them without any whole Bone, we scarified the Lips of the wound and washt them with <hi>Spi. vin.</hi> with a little <hi>aegyptiac.</hi> dissolved in it, and dressing the ends of the Bones with Pledgets dipt in it, and prest out, we drest the rest of the Bone with <hi>ung. Basilic.</hi> with a little <hi>ol. Terebinth.</hi> warm, with an Empl. of <hi>Paracels. &amp; diacalcith</hi> mixt, and applyed it over the wound and parts about with a Compress and Bandage over that, as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Fractures, and placing the Leg as before upon a Pillow, he was again put in to his Bed, we committing him now to the care of his friends to keep him still, and ordered him Cordial Julips, &amp;c. and after some hours Let him bloud again. From that time his pains lessened, and his Fever and other ill Symptomes went off as the wound digested. But after some daies, the heel became very painful and was discovered to us Inflamed with an Ulceration to the very Bone. The Patient not permitting to have his foot stir'd, it had not been raised up, as for perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it ought to have been, whence this Ulcer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very troublesome to us. For a present relief we laid him upon his side, and drest the Ulcer with
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41836:149"/>Lenients to hasten separation of that Escar, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Patient grew soon weary of this position, which also was inconvenient for our dressing the great wound, we therefore designed an Instrument of Tin to receive his foot and leg, his heel to lye hollow in a place cut for the purpose, whereby we could daily dress it without disturbing the Patient, only placing him down lower toward the Beds feet, as the heel might lye over it; the side of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument that came up by the wound, was to be taken off at time of dressing his wound, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward placed close again, whereby he was drest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disturbing the weak Member. It lay also soft by the folds of Linnen we placed under, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Leg and Instrument, and was kept straight in hopes it might be supplied with <hi>Callus,</hi> but the wound became Sinuous, the Matter fowling the Bones, hindred the growth of <hi>Callus,</hi> and while we waited for Exfoliation, the Lips of the Ulcer became callous, which prolong'd the Cure: The Ulcer in the heel we digested, and after we found the Bone would not Incarn, we drest it with <hi>aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiac.</hi> with a little <hi>Merc. Subl.</hi> dissolved in it, by which dressing we hastened the Exfoliation of the Bones, and cured the Ulcer: The wound above was after the generation of <hi>Callus</hi> cured, as a <hi>Fistula</hi> with a carious Bone. The Patient lived many years after, but through the ill disposition of the Ulcer, the <hi>Callus</hi> was hindred in its growth, whereby the Leg remained the shorter almost as much as had been Sawed off of the Bone; yet this was better I suppose than to leave the Bone distorted until digestion, as in a such like case I have seen it.</p>
                     <p>But if the Bone be not so much distorted, as that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41836:150"/>you may come to Saw off the end of it, nor yet cannot reduce the Bone after the ordinary way, then you may with a Chizil-like Instrument, thrust between the Fractured ends of the Bone, and use it after the manner of a leaver for the reduction of the prominencies; But then it's supposed these fractured ends of them are within the wound, and not much over-shot one another, and the Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is transverse or oblique, otherwise this way will do little good; Nay possibly Rive up the piece of bone, and make another kind of Fracture, and grievously pain your Patient; and that you may do if the ends break off upon your hard and unsteddy Extension: Therefore it becomes us to be very wary in making this extension, else I say, we may grievously pain our Patient, and do him little good.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude, after your extension is made, and the Bone reduced, you are to feel if there be any Shivers of bones loose, and pull them out; and if you perform this operation in a fracture newly made, then you are to prevent Inflamation and all other accidents, by dressing up the Patient with such Medicines as hath been proposed in compound Fractures, and make your Bandage so as you may come to dress the wound, as occasion shall offer, with as little molestation to the Fractured Member as is possible, having a care you grieve not the tender parts with Splints, until the Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be over, and the wound well digested.</p>
                     <p>Then afterwards 'tis to be endeavoured, that the bones rob'd of their <hi>periostium</hi> may again be Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated or Exfoliated, which is the work of Nature, yet ought to be helpt by Medicines, which have a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41836:150"/>manifest hot quality and a peculiar faculty thereto, of which there are are enough in the Treatise of Gun-shot-wounds.</p>
                     <p>The Bones Exfoliated, the rest will do it self, or may be performed by <hi>Epuloticks,</hi> of which you may have choice in this Book.</p>
